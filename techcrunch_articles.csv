"With its latest acqui-hire, OpenAI is doubling down on personalized consumer AI",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/with-its-latest-acqui-hire-openai-is-doubling-down-on-personalized-consumer-ai/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T15:52:14-07:00,"OpenAI has acquired Roi, an AI-powered personal finance app. In keeping with a recent trend in the AI industry, only the CEO is making the jump. Chief executive and co-founder Sujith Vishwajith announced the acquisition on Friday, and a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch he is the only one of Roi’s four-person staff to join OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15. The Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including Context.ai , Crossing Minds , and Alex . While it’s not clear whether any of Roi’s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI’s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale — a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly. New York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user’s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades. “We started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,” Vishwajith wrote in a post on X . “Along the way we realized personalization isn’t just the future of finance. It’s the future of software.” Beyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them. In one telling example that Roi posted on X , the sample user wrote: “Talk to me like I’m a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don’t mind.” In response to a query about the status of the user’s portfolio, Roi replied: “Suje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12…Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.” The exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder — that software shouldn’t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged. As the Roi team wrote in a blog post: “The products we use every day won’t remain static, predetermined experiences. They’ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.” That vision dovetails with OpenAI’s existing consumer efforts, including Pulse , which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the Sora app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and Instant Checkout , a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT. The deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team, led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo . It’s a further signal that OpenAI isn’t just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi’s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive. Vishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his account , a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash. Being able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through billions on data centers and infrastructure to power its models.

Sources: Naveen Rao’s new AI hardware startup targets $5B valuation with backing from a16z,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/sources-naveen-raos-new-ai-hardware-startup-targets-5b-valuation-with-backing-from-a16z/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T14:56:58-07:00,"Naveen Rao, who was formerly the head of artificial intelligence at Databricks, is in talks to raise $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation for a new startup called Unconventional, Inc., that’s building a new type of computer, according to four people familiar with discussions. Andreessen Horowitz has agreed to lead the investment, and Lightspeed and Lux Capital are also participating in the deal, two of the sources said, although none of those VC firms responded to our request for comment. Databricks is also said to be investing in Rao’s new company, Bloomberg reported last month. Rao has already raised hundreds of millions and plans to begin building the startup without waiting for the full $1 billion round to close, our sources said. He plans to raise the rest of the capital in installments, a funding approach commonly referred to as a “tranched” round. Rao declined to comment, although he did publicly acknowledge the new startup on X last week, confirming its name and describing its hoped-for product as “rethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology. Brain Scale Efficiency without the biological baggage!” Databricks acquired Rao’s previous startup, MosaicML in 2023 , for $1.3 billion. Founded by Rao in 2020 with a focus on training and deploying large AI models, MosaicML raised $33.7 million from investors, including Lux Capital, DCVC, Playground Global, and Samsung Next, according to PitchBook. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems , which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million. Rao, who spent over two years as VP of AI at Databricks (now valued at $100 billion and generating $4 billion in ARR), left the company last month to focus on his new startup, according to his LinkedIn profile and earlier reporting by Bloomberg. Our sources say Rao’s vision will essentially compete with Nvidia by designing a novel AI machine that includes both custom silicon chips and server infrastructure.

Can you think like a YC partner? This game will help you find out,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/can-you-think-like-a-yc-partner-this-game-will-help-you-find-out/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T11:36:53-07:00,"Welcome to YC Arena , which is not a top secret fight club for Y Combinator founders but rather a suite of games that give you a vague sense of what it’s like to be a partner at YC. Created by a student in Berlin, YC Arena’s YC Partner Simulator game shows you a publicly available pitch video from a company that applied to YC, along with the year of their application. You click “accept” or “reject,” and then find out if you made the same choice as YC. It’s a lot harder than it looks. YC is estimated to accept around 1% of applicants , and at a certain point, some luck is required to really capture a partner’s eye — maybe your pitch is the first that a partner watched after a very rejuvenating coffee break, or maybe your company is the last video on the list and everyone’s tired. “Many rejected founders went on to build incredibly successful companies afterwards,” reads a note at the start of the game. “Rejection means nothing — even the most successful founders got rejected multiple times.” YC Arena has other games that ask you to match a company name to its logo, or guess what year a company did YC based on its description (spoiler alert: There’s a lot more AI in recent years). But the YC Partner Simulator game is the most interesting since it makes us confront our own decision-making processes. As a tech journalist, I thought I would be pretty good at the YC Partner Simulator. I may not be an investor, but I know what it’s like to sift through an inbox full of startup pitches and choose which ones pique my curiosity — I’ve walked the floor of TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield 200 Expo with the task of identifying companies to interview and write about. But this game is hard. After all, we’re working within different parameters, since the newsworthiness of a company is not directly tied to its potential to turn a profit. (For example: As I write this, there’s an AI pet sitting in my lap that I’m planning to review. Would I put money on the bet that Casio will turn a profit off the investment it takes to create a glorified Furby that retails for $430 ? No. Do I expect that an article about my life with an AI pet will be interesting to readers? Yes.) If anything, the game shows just how subjective these processes can be. But after I read YC co-founder Paul Graham’s application guide , my guesses started to get more accurate. “You have to be exceptionally clear and concise,” Graham wrote. “Whatever you have to say, give it to us right in the first sentence, in the simplest possible terms.” (For the record, this advice also applies to emailing journalists.) I played the game again, but this time, I paid less attention to what the company was pitching and more attention to how quickly they could convey what their company does. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend this strategy for evaluating a startup in real life (hot take: you should care what a company does!), but for the purposes of the game, I ended up choosing a company’s fate more accurately. This probably isn’t a coincidence. When OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman was president of YC, he remarked in an interview that the incubator spent just 10 minutes reviewing each company’s application to make a decision. “It turns out that in 10 minutes, if the only question you’re trying to answer is, ‘Does this person have the potential to be the next Mark Zuckerberg?’ … You can answer that question in 10 minutes,” Altman said in 2016. “Not with 100 percent accuracy, obviously, but good enough that our business model works.”  Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Graham, Sam Altman, Furby, Paul Graham, Mark Zuckerberg","Y Combinator, TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield 200, Altman, TechCrunch, YC Arena",$430 ,,AI

"Supabase nabs $5B valuation, four months after hitting $2B",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/supabase-nabs-5b-valuation-four-months-after-hitting-2b/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T11:14:03-07:00,"It’s been a whirlwind year for the vibe-coding world’s database of choice: Supabase. On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel. And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money. So that’s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook’s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says. Open source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google’s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps. Supabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools — which write apps with natural language prompts — like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor , and Claude Code , it says. Interestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers — claiming 4 million developers as users — it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.

New deep tech fund Wave Function Ventures raises $15 million,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/new-deep-tech-fund-wave-function-ventures-raises-15-million/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T06:00:11-07:00,"When Jamie Gull graduated from Stanford University in 2007 with a master’s degree in aeronautics, there was one place he wanted to go next: the desert. The Mojave Desert, to be specific. A company called Scaled Composites had spent years developing experimental aircraft out on that arid land, and Gull wanted in. He could have tried to get a more traditional aerospace job, but Gull was worried he’d “work five years on a latch” — a common joke about those bigger, slow-moving companies. But at Scaled Composites? “I knew I would build something, and I would do it quickly, and I would be a college graduate who would own an actual outcome,” he said. Two years later, Gull jumped to SpaceX, where he helped make the Falcon 9 rocket reusable — a major milestone in that company’s history, and the foundation on which it has built an enormously valuable business. Now, Gull is gearing up for a new challenge: launching an early-stage deep tech fund called Wave Function Ventures . Just last week, he closed Wave Function’s first fund of $15.1 million, and he’s already off and running. Gull has made nine investments in startups that span industries like nuclear energy (Deep Fission), humanoid robotics (Persona AI), and, of course, aerospace (Airship Industries). He told TechCrunch he expects to do about 25 seed or pre-seed investments out of this fund. (Gull declined to name the anchor LP, and said the rest of the fund was filled by high-net-worth individuals, with support from other funds and “large family offices.”) Wave Function’s emergence comes at a time when deep tech funding is on the rise, buoyed in part by the increased attention on fields like aerospace and defense. It’s enough of a trend that earlier this year, a new Silicon Valley-based deep tech fund called Leitmotif broke cover with $300 million in capital from the Volkswagen Group , part of a bid to lift up hardware and manufacturing startups in the United States and Europe. It’s the kind of environment that seems ripe for someone with a background like Gull’s — and not just his past as an accomplished aerospace engineer. Near the end of his time at SpaceX in 2016, Gull started angel investing, making bets on companies like Boom Supersonic, K2 Space, and Varda. He also co-founded electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startup Talyn Air as part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and became a venture partner at YC’s Pioneer Fund — a position he still holds. (Talyn was acquired in 2023 by another eVTOL company, Ampaire.) Gull wants to put all this varied experience — doing rapid prototyping, founding a startup, angel investing — to use at Wave Function. “I can really leverage that to help all my founders get through those early stages when things are like the most uncertain, and then help them build their companies,” he said. Gull also believes deep tech is going to be a place for big returns in the next 10 to 20 years. Startups in this space may require more capital up front, he said, but they can leverage non-venture funding (like government contracts or asset-backed lending) to scale and establish a more solid moat than software companies. Getting to those big returns will take time and Gull is fine with that. While he began his career as an eager builder, he also knows the value of patience. When he was at Scaled Composites 15 years ago, one of the projects he worked on was Stratolaunch, the largest plane in the world at the time. It was such an enormously complex aircraft that it remained in development long after Gull moved to SpaceX and beyond. It wasn’t until 2019 when Gull and his Talyn co-founder Evan Mucasey were planning to head to a “fly-in” (think: car show but for cool planes) at the Mojave airport that he got a hint he might see the giant airplane fly. “I called a friend and said, ‘what time should we be there for the airplane show?’ And he said, ‘6 a.m.’ I was like, that makes no sense,” Gull said. He didn’t know what his friend was hinting at, but he believed it would be worth the early flight. Sure enough, as Gull and Mucasey approached the airport, there was Stratolaunch, parked on the runway and prepped for flight. They landed and, per Gull’s recollection, Stratolaunch took off 15 minutes later. “I think it was almost exactly 10 years after I had worked on it on a computer screen,” Gull said. “It was wild.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Evan Mucasey, Persona AI, Talyn Air, SpaceX, Jamie Gull, K2 Space, Wave Function, Talyn, Mucasey, Mojave, Gull","Leitmotif, Stanford University, Wave Function Ventures, Falcon, the Volkswagen Group, TechCrunch, Boom Supersonic, Wave Function, YC’s Pioneer Fund, Airship Industries, Stratolaunch","$15.1 m, $300 m",,AI
A new search engine raises $1.1M to let obsessive fans dive down internet rabbit holes,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/a-new-search-engine-raises-1-1m-to-let-obsessive-fans-dive-down-internet-rabbit-holes/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-03T06:00:00-07:00,"Zehra Naqvi, 26, grew up as an obsessive fan girl in the 2010s. This was the era of Tumblr and Twitter. She would stay up all night breaking down the release dates of Marvel movies or analyzing the movements of One Direction members. She eventually gained a collective 250,000 followers across the two platforms. “Those early internet rabbit holes taught me how magical it felt to not just consume culture but to contribute to it,” she told TechCrunch. She went on to start a company at 12, study art history at Columbia, and then became a consumer investor at Headline Ventures. (She also writes the popular consumer newsletter The Z List. ) Now, she’s starting something new: Lore , a search platform for people to research and discover internet obsessions. The company has already raised $1.1 million in pre-seed funding. It is set to emerge from stealth on October 6. It was a few months ago that she quit her job at Headline and decided to go back to the beginning. She recalled those early days of spiraling down internet rabbit holes and became dismayed when she realized that all that research she spent hours in the pleasure pursuit of was gone. “How is it possible that I’ve spent probably well over 500 hours reading about Marvel movies over 17 years and no single platform tracks my consumption,” she said. Lore provides the tools she wished “had existed when fandom felt like home before the internet became fractured and joyless,” she said. It lets consumers go down rabbit holes, providing links to fan theories, interpretations, cultural context, and easter eggs. According to Naqvi, it builds a personalized graph of obsessions; surfaces fandom and stan updates in a feed; and gives monthly reports to users about what their obsessions are at any given time. “You can zoom in on a single theory or zoom out and see how all your fandoms connect,” Naqvi said. “It’s like playing with knowledge instead of just consuming it.” Naqvi is mum for now on how the product works. She also declined to share any imagery, saying that Lore’s official hard launch isn’t until next year. “It’s our special sauce,” she said of the technology powering the product. She did say, however, that rapid fandom consumption hasn’t really changed online, even though new social media channels have popped up for users to interact. “If anything, fandom is more fragmented than ever, and as you get older, joy spiraling becomes harder to find time for,” she said. As an investor, she began to realize that perhaps there didn’t need to be any more social tools for fans. “There are plenty of places to yap,” she said, adding that so much of social media these days aims for quick dopamine hits, doomscrolling, or feeds into “iPad kid behavior.” The next version of social media will be quieter, she said, more human, and built around passion and memory. “Lore is our attempt to rebuild the Library of Alexandria for the fandom age.” Naqvi is a solo founder and has already made her first two hires: a marketing executive and an engineer. She described her fundraising process as “obsessive.” Village Global led the round with participation from Precursor Ventures. “Lore is building the product fandoms have been waiting for,” Charles Hudson, managing partner at Precursor Ventures, told TechCrunch. “We envision it as the essential app for fandoms to gather, share, and deepen their engagement with the things they love.” Naqvi said the fresh capital will be used to attract more users and continue running product testing. “We wrapped up an experiment with over 1,000 logins, nearly 24,000 searches, and a collective eight days, or about 200 hours straight of spiraling deep into obsessions,” she said. “That level of engagement is kind of insane and proves the need for what we are building.” Lore is not without competition. In the age of AI search engines, she said, people have drawn comparisons to Perplexity, while others note it provides the same function as Reddit or Wikipedia. “But none of these spaces were built with fandom in mind,” she said. “We are building a lurker-first space,” she continued, describing Lore as “interactive, colorful, and designed for play. She hopes Lore will restore some joy to the internet and create a place where obsession is not embarrassing, but sacred. “Consumer AI doesn’t always have to be an agent that helps you shop or a glorified assistant or another social app,” she said. “There are so many more inventive and joy-first ways to apply it, and Lore is proving that.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Twitter, stan, Charles Hudson, Alexandria, Naqvi, Lore, Zehra Naqvi","Wikipedia, Perplexity, Headline Ventures, Tumblr, Marvel, Precursor Ventures, iPad, TechCrunch, Columbia",$1.1 m,,AI
How startups could be affected by a prolonged government shutdown,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/how-startups-could-be-affected-by-a-prolonged-government-shutdown/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-02T09:05:22-07:00,"The U.S. government shutdown could stifle deal flow, freeze visa processing for workers, and cause other problems for startups and the broader tech sector, especially if it lasts longer than a week, according to experts who spoke to TechCrunch. The U.S. government shutdown, which began Tuesday, is the first one in seven years. The unpredictability of the Trump administration coupled with a politically entrenched Congress makes it hard to predict when the shutdown will end. Out of eight shutdowns since 1990, four have happened during Trump administrations; the last one lasted 35 days, the longest in modern history. TechCrunch spoke to investors, founders, and lawyers who warned about delayed deal flow and visa processing for workers. The visa process had already been upended when President Trump recently announced the application fee for an H-1B visa would increase to $100,000 — a number that caused sticker shock within the industry. The main concern is a slowed-down immigration process for startups, since the Department of Labor — which provides first approval for H-1B visas and green cards — is shut down. The result, immigration attorney Sophie Alcorn said, is that the pipeline for hiring and renewing visas for high-skilled workers is completely frozen. “This creates significant uncertainty for a startup’s workforce, including founders who may be on visas themselves,” she told TechCrunch. “Visa workers are hit hard in a shutdown because their status depends on government approvals,” Michael Scarpati, CEO and founder of the fintech RetireUS, added. “When processes like E-Verify or labor certifications stop, workers risk falling out of status, leaving their future in the U.S. uncertain and creating added disruption for the businesses that depend on them.” Thousands of workers in tech are on visas, many of them bringing partners and children with them. “Many are understandably nervous about processing delays and how that affects their ability to stay and work,” Chris Chib, CEO of the strategy solutions company BlueFin Solves, told TechCrunch. “But just as these engineers help us persevere through complex challenges with ML algorithms and innovation, we owe them the same careful attention and commitment during this situation.” Startups may also be affected by delayed or stopped permitting processes and other regulatory requirements, which could drain precious funds and even lead to layoffs. Jenny Fielding, managing partner at Everywhere Ventures, said ongoing political uncertainty always worries her. Though past shutdowns have had little economic impact, this one could lead to layoffs if it lasts too long. “Since we invest in many regulated areas, the shutdown can potentially halt-slash-slow down essential government functions like FDA approvals or aerospace permits, which can be an existential threat to a startup whose entire business model depends on a single regulatory green light,” Fielding told TechCrunch. Fielding said the timing of the shutdown has, once again, been terrible for her and the firm. When Everywhere Ventures started fundraising in early spring, President Trump announced the tariffs that caused uncertainty and drove up costs for some companies. The firm held off on fundraising at the time because limited partners were nervous about investing given the uncertain climate. “And of course, we kicked off fundraising this week, so once again, terrible timing,” she said. As for Fielding’s startups, she said it’s hard to wait and see in this case. Founders always need to think about a Plan B, she said, especially because capital is finite. “If it’s a week shutdown, then that’s manageable,” she continued. “But when it becomes weeks, then it can get uncomfortable.” Garima Kapoor co-founded the software company MinIO with her husband, AB, who came to the U.S. on an H-1B visa a little over a decade ago. She said startups should start preparing now, just in case the government shutdown is prolonged. “When government agencies slow down, deals in highly regulated industries like fintech, health tech, or M&A can grind to a halt. Even companies operating outside the federal sphere could face shrinking valuations and tougher deal terms as more uncertainty seeps into the market,” she told TechCrunch. Overall, founders should remain proactive, communicate transparently with partners and investors, and plan “prudently for slippage,” she said, noting that clarity and alignment will be key here. “Preparedness will separate those who weather the disruption from those who get caught flat-footed.” Chib echoed that sentiment. “Their resilience is part of what drives progress forward,” he said. ”To those facing these challenges, know this too shall pass. Persevere.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Trump, Chris Chib, Michael Scarpati, Garima Kapoor, Jenny Fielding","Trump, Visa, FDA, Sophie Alcorn, RetireUS, Everywhere Ventures, Fielding’s, TechCrunch, the Department of Labor, BlueFin Solves, Congress, ML",$100,hiring,"AI, FINTECH"

The AI-powered shopping assistant has become one of 2025’s buzziest launches, not only for its vision of how Gen Z shops, but also for the powerhouse founders leading it: Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni . At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 , happening October 27–29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, the two will take to the Disrupt Stage to share how they’re building Phia into a durable consumer brand, what it takes to scale in one of tech’s most competitive markets, and how they’re turning viral buzz into lasting market influence. Phia aims to reinvent the way digital natives discover, compare, and shop for products — blending AI assistance with the values of conscious consumerism.

Gates and Kianni are betting that the next generation of consumer AI must deliver on all of those fronts at once. Phoebe Gates , co-founder of Phia, is an entrepreneur and passionate advocate for women’s reproductive rights and gender equity. A Stanford graduate in human biology, she has worked with global healthcare leaders, activists, and advocates to drive meaningful social change. Gates applies her entrepreneurial focus to inspire a new generation of women in business. Recognized by Reproductive Freedom for All as the 2024 “Rising Reproductive Freedom Champion,” she continues to be a voice for progress while building Phia into a leading AI shopping brand. Sophia Kianni is the co-founder of Phia. She is an Iranian American entrepreneur and climate activist who has made waves as the founder of Climate Cardinals , the world’s largest youth-led climate nonprofit. Named to Forbes 30 Under 30 and BBC’s 100 Women, she also served as the youngest UN climate adviser in U.S. history. Now she’s applying her storytelling and advocacy expertise to scale Phia. A Stanford alumna, Kianni is focused on using AI to empower smarter, more sustainable consumer choices. Scaling a consumer AI brand is not just about tech — it’s about winning trust, adapting quickly to market shifts, and knowing how to stand out in a noisy space. Gates and Kianni will discuss: With more than 10,000 founders, investors, and operators set to gather at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, this session is a must-see for anyone building in consumer AI, commerce, or brand-driven tech who wants to win Gen Z loyalty.

OpenAI is the world’s most valuable private company after private stock sale,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/openai-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-private-company-after-private-stock-sale/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-02T07:35:44-07:00,"OpenAI has sold $6.6 billion in shares held by current and former employees, according to a new report from Bloomberg . The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI , often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses . OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August , when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans . OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft , which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

The company noted on its site that the team would be joining a new Agent Experiences group at Perplexity. Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity’s CEO, confirmed the acquisition with a post on X. Deal terms were not disclosed. The startup said that as part of the transition, it will shut down Visual Electric as a product in 90 days. It added that users will be able to export their data, and subscribers will get prorated refunds. Visual Electric was founded in 2022 by Colin Dunn, a former Facebook and Dropbox employee; Adam Menges, a former Apple employee; and Zach Stiggelbout, a former Microsoft engineer. The tool, aimed at designers, lets users create images using AI and apply edits on an infinite canvas. The idea was to have designers build ideations and concepts over a whiteboard. Over time, the company added support for video generation, as well. The startup had raised $2.5 million in funding from Sequoia, BoxGroup, and Designer Fund.

Oneleet raises $33M to shake up the world of security compliance,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/oneleet-raises-33m-to-shake-up-the-world-of-security-compliance/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-02T05:00:00-07:00,"Bryan Onel’s father was a locksmith. As for Onel, he described himself as the digital equivalent. Ethical hacking was Onel’s hobby growing up. He studied AI at university and then turned that hacking hobby into a profession. “I spent a decade performing penetration tests for over 150 companies across all sectors,” Onel tells TechCrunch, adding that he kept easily breaking into companies that had passed their security checks. Onel realized that security often fell within two brackets: Painful but effective, or painless but ineffective. Most companies were doing the bare minimum in cybersecurity and compliance, as it often takes too much work — and tools and talent — to provide effective security defenses. Onel’s clients kept asking if he could provide a solution to their problems, so he gave it a shot. In 2022, he teamed up with his wife, Ora, and college friend Erik Vogelzang and launched Oneleet, an all-in-one security compliance platform. The startup aims to help other companies get their security certifications while helping them become more secure faster. Onel tells TechCrunch that most existing compliance platforms are evidence-collection tools, where users import data from their various products, pay a fee, and then — voilà! — out spits a security certificate saying they are secure. “The result is compliance theater,” Onel tells TechCrunch. “You’re certified on paper, but still vulnerable to all kinds of attacks.” Oneleet is different, said Onel. The platform includes a suite of security tools: penetrating testing, code scanning, cloud data security, attack surface management, security training, and more, he said, which aims to provide a better window into a company’s security defenses. “Because it’s integrated from the ground up, we can deploy comprehensive security with the click of a button,” Onel continued. “That saves clients hundreds of hours and eliminates the blind spots that come from managing fragmented tools.” Oneleet then partners with independent auditors to provide formal certification reviews. On Thursday, Oneleet announced it raised a $33 million Series A funding round led by Dawn Capital to help grow the business. Onel called his fundraising process “straightforward” and said he met Dawn Capital in San Francisco, where he described “immediate chemistry.” “They already had deep knowledge of the security and compliance space and immediately understood what we were building at Oneleet, so there was instant alignment,” said Onel. Other investors in the round include Y Combinator, Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, and former Snowflake and ServiceNow chief executive Frank Slootman. Oneleet participated in the Summer 2022 class of Y Combinator and said two-thirds of new additions to the VC firm’s portfolio companies are now its clients. Competitors in this space include Vanta, Secureframe, and Sprinto. For its part, Oneleet has reached $9 million in annual recurring revenue and has raised $35 million in total to date. The fresh cash injection will be used to expand Oneleet’s engineering team, increase its AI capabilities, and find ways to reach more customers. The goal is to end security theater in compliance, he said, at a time when defending against cyberattacks is more important than ever. Onel said that AI is changing the scale of cyberattacks. He said, for example, advanced bad actors are automating cybercrimes, while lowering the bar for novice hackers to strike with malicious attacks. He said companies are also being reckless, like carelessly using “vibe coding” tools, or giving AI access to business-critical information without the right guardrails. In the world of compliance, Onel said, companies can use AI to generate fake documentation to make it seem as if the business is more secure than it is. Onel says his company heavily uses AI, working in the background for threat modeling and other security assessments, and also helps draft policies. But, he said, the company has a human team verifying information so the client does not see any hallucinations. “We’re responsible about it,” he said. “Good security should be invisible,” Onel continued. “Companies should spend less time worrying about security and more time building great products. We have a shot at helping companies defend themselves more effectively than ever before.” This story was updated to fix errors regarding ARR.

"Visa crackdowns are blocking students’ study-abroad dreams, so India’s Leverage Edu is rerouting them",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/visa-crackdowns-are-blocking-students-study-abroad-dreams-so-indias-leverage-edu-is-rerouting-them/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T16:26:15-07:00,"As visa crackdowns and diplomatic tensions block traditional study-abroad routes, India’s Leverage Edu is helping students reroute their dreams — from Canada to Germany, and from India to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. That agility is paying off: The startup has doubled its revenue, turned profitable, and is now expanding its global footprint. Over the past several months, students across emerging markets have faced growing uncertainty around international college admissions. Shifting visa rules and diplomatic tensions — from the 2023-2024 standoff between India and Canada to new strains in India-U.S. ties over tariffs and immigration policy — have disrupted application timelines and eligibility for thousands. Countries such as Canada and Australia have introduced stricter student visa policies , catching many families off guard. Even long-standing local consultants and study-abroad firms have struggled to adapt. Meanwhile, Leverage — the startup behind the study-abroad platform Leverage Edu — has responded by helping students identify alternative destinations and adjust quickly, keeping their plans on track despite the disruption. The eight-year-old startup was quick to respond when India-Canada relations soured, helping Indian students reroute to Germany and assisting Canadian universities in recruiting from Nigeria — effectively salvaging student pipelines in both regions. It is now applying that same playbook amid ongoing U.S.-India strains. While Leverage continues to send students to the U.S., a growing share of that demand now comes from countries like Brazil and Vietnam — where interest in U.S. universities remains strong, founder and CEO Akshay Chaturvedi said in an interview. That ability to shift quickly across geographies is now central to Leverage’s growth strategy. In the last two months, the startup has expanded into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Vietnam, and Malaysia — emerging markets with growing numbers of students seeking to study abroad but with limited access to structured admissions support. With this push, Leverage now operates in 16 countries where it recruits students, helping them apply to universities across 11 destination countries. Beyond applications, the startup — headquartered in Noida, a tech hub on the outskirts of New Delhi — is positioning itself as a full-service platform for international education, helping students plan, finance, and manage their journeys. Its tools include a mobile app, an AI-powered course search engine, a university matchmaking tool called UniConnect, and a newly launched SaaS suite for global universities under the brand Univalley.ai. The startup has also expanded into adjacent categories, with offerings like Leverage MBBS for medical aspirants under Leverage Edu, as well as Fly Finance for education loans, Fly Homes for student housing, and other services under Leverage Careers and Compass. Leverage now places over 10,000 students annually, up from around 1,500 just a few years ago. Much of that growth has come through organic demand, with 60% of student acquisitions requiring zero customer acquisition cost, according to Chaturvedi. “Our gap has narrowed with most of our global competitors who were either large listed companies or who had raised some of these mega rounds,” he told TechCrunch. Financially, Leverage has seen sharp growth — and turned profitable for the first time this year, a rarity in India’s edtech sector. The startup closed fiscal year 2025 with over ₹1.8 billion (around $20 million) in revenue, doubling from the previous year’s ₹900 million (approximately $10 million). Between April and September, the first half of fiscal year 2026, it generated more than ₹2 billion (roughly $23 million), and is on track to end the fiscal year with ₹3.7-₹3.8 billion (about $45 million) in revenue. On the profitability front, Leverage garnered ₹120-130 million (approximately $1.4-1.5 million) in profit after tax, and expects to surpass ₹250 million ($2.8 million) by the end of fiscal year 2026 — marking a 256% turnaround from a full-year loss of ₹800 million in fiscal year 2025. The startup generates around 25% of its revenue from its platform businesses, which support students beyond admissions — with value-added services including loans, money remittance, housing, and assistance with securing internships or first jobs. The remaining 75% of revenue comes from its core education business —  the student placement and counseling services. Within that, about 20% comes directly from students and 55% from universities in commissions, Chaturvedi told TechCrunch. India remains Leverage’s largest source market, accounting for 58% of its total student base. Within the country, the startup focuses on states like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Punjab — regions that consistently send large numbers of students to universities abroad. In terms of destinations, the U.K. remains Leverage’s largest market, accounting for 52% of student placements, followed by Germany at 22%. Italy — its fastest-growing market this summer — is also gaining traction. North America currently represents less than 5% of total placements for Leverage, reflecting tightened visa rules and diplomatic headwinds in recent years. The startup expects this share to grow as its presence expands across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. With rising revenues and an expanding global footprint, the startup is now weighing a potential IPO in India as early as next year, and investment bankers have already made early pitches, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Founder and CEO Chaturvedi did not deny the possibility of a public listing, but he said Leverage would decide between pursuing an IPO or raising external capital after hitting the $100 million revenue milestone, which the company expects to reach sometime in 2026. So far, Leverage has raised less than $50 million in equity. The company operates across 27 countries through over 50 offices and has a headcount of around 800 people.

Self-driving trucks startup Einride raises $100M,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/self-driving-trucks-startup-einride-raises-100m/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T15:13:55-07:00,"Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, said Wednesday it has raised $100 million from several new and existing investors, including its largest shareholder, EQT Ventures. The raise included an undisclosed strategic investment from quantum computing company IonQ. Neither Einride, nor its investors, disclosed the company’s post-money valuation. The funding comes as Einride adjusts to a new CEO and tries to scale its three business products: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers. Einride CEO Roozbeh Charli said the funding would allow the company to grow with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology. The company, which was founded in 2016, started in Sweden with a mission to disrupt the freight industry — first with electric trucks, then with electric autonomous pods, which are purpose-built without a steering wheel or pedals for self-driving. Einride has expanded beyond Sweden and operates a fleet of heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States. “We believe Einride is building the most complete and forward-looking freight ecosystem on the market today,” Ted Persson, partner at EQT Ventures, said in a statement. “Nordic tech has a habit of being underestimated, until it quietly rewires an entire industry. That’s exactly what Einride is doing in freight.” Still, Einride has undergone internal changes and has grappled — along with the rest of the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector — with the long and expensive process of moving from development to commercial operations. Five months ago, Einride co-founder Robert Falck left the CEO role and took over as executive chairman of the board to focus on the company’s long-term strategy. Charli, who had been CFO, was promoted to the top leadership position. The company previously raised $500 million in 2022 in a Series C round of equity and debt. The equity-based $200 million portion came from backers including Northzone, EQT Ventures, Temasek, Swedish pension fund AMF, Polar Structure, and Norrsken VC. It also secured $300 million in debt funding led by Barclays Europe.

Meet the end-of-life planning startup co-founded by NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/meet-the-end-of-life-planning-startup-co-founded-by-nba-all-star-russell-westbrook/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T09:00:15-07:00,"When Donnell Beverly Jr. decided to launch end-of-life planning startup Eazewell after the loss of both of his parents, he knew exactly who to call to help launch the business: longtime friend, and nine-time NBA All-Star, Russell Westbrook. “The main thesis with Russ across every business that he touches is how do we impact people?” Beverly Jr. [pictured above] told TechCrunch. “He’s been very vocal about that throughout his career. I always say we really took personal pain and then created a platform to really help people.” Westbrook was in. Four-time NBA All-Star Kemba Walker also joined, and the trio launched Eazewell. Eazewell is an AI-driven platform that helps families navigate and automate the administrative aspects of end-of-life and funeral planning. The startup’s AI agent gives people a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week resource and helps users with everything from finding and booking a funeral home to canceling credit card accounts for a deceased person. The company partners with different service providers, like hospice care, funeral homes, and various insurance companies, which allows the platform to be free to use with the option of paying for more premium features. “I had an opportunity to be able to be close with his family and go through the process with [Beverly Jr.],” Westbrook told TechCrunch. “He’s done an amazing job of idealizing this idea and bringing it to life. I’m excited to kind of be a partner with him [and] alongside him on this.” Beverly Jr. said he got the idea for Eazewell after losing both of his parents in a short period of time. Navigating what came after their deaths made him realize how large of a burden the end-of-life process can be — and how fragmented the market of these services is. He added that seeing the recent advancements in AI made him realize the technology could be used to help reduce the number of administrative tasks grieving families need to tackle following a death. “We’ve seen how AI has impacted our lives while we’re here, but you know now we’re entering a space where it’s impacting our lives after death,” Beverly Jr. said. Eazewell was founded in 2024. The company said it has been able to help more than 100,000 families since its launched its platform earlier this year. Now, Eazewell is rolling out a new enterprise platform for hospice companies, senior living facilities, and life insurers. This allows companies to fold Eazewell’s automated features into their own management software. In the future, Eazwell hopes to help people manage a loved one’s digital assets after they pass, a task that has become a bigger undertaking as people’s lives are increasingly online. “The average person has anywhere between 70 and 100 digital accounts that are active at any time,” Beverly Jr. said. “Your family is inheriting all those digital accounts and those digital assets as well. And that’s not typical. We’re stepping into a new kind of realm within that. When we look at the whole landscape, we see a grand opportunity to not only help people but just make it a lot more seamless.” For Westbrook, Eazewell offers the perfect opportunity to go into business with a decades-long friend while also being able to use his platform to amplify a business that can help people — especially those from underserved and under-resourced communities — navigate this painful and costly experience. “Anytime I put my name on anything, I try to find ways to open doors, build trust, find ways to play a big role in it and be present because I think that’s important,” Westbrook said. “And this isn’t about me or being super technical by any means, but it’s more importantly about families finding ways to be able to help them through a loss. And for me, using my platform to be able to do that is a no-brainer.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Russell Westbrook, Westbrook, Russ, Eazwell, Donnell Beverly Jr.","Westbrook, Eazewell’s, Eazewell, TechCrunch, NBA",,,AI
Prickly Pear Health will showcase how it’s helping women’s brain health at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/prickly-pear-health-will-showcase-how-its-helping-womens-brain-health-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T08:54:53-07:00,"Iman Clark, CEO of Prickly Pear Health, says she had an epiphany that eventually led her to TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 . It was around nine years ago. She moved from Tunisia to the U.S. for grad school, then joined a company that created gamified experiences for people with neurodegenerative conditions, like dementia. This was done by giving them a tablet or a computer and letting them play games while doctors collected data on them, like their risk of falling and overall range of motion. “I realized that most people, 75-plus, have two to three chronic conditions, and no matter what we did, it is always going to be hard,” she told TechCrunch. “Then I went back to the research and saw that like, 70% of the Alzheimer’s population are women.” She dug deeper and found that women were twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and three to four times more likely to be diagnosed with migraines. “That’s when I realized we are not really solving for women’s biology, and that is costing us lives and dollars.” So she created Prickly Pear Health , which provides medical support for women’s brain health, a voice-first, AI-powered companion that helps women in their 30s to 50s navigate the hormonal changes that affect brain health. The product lets people record quick reflections throughout the day using their voice and Prickly Pear’s AI technology analyzes their language and context to track any cognitive changes. Prickly Pear Health will show of its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt , which runs October 27 to 29 in San Francisco. It also pulls in sleep data, heart rate activity, and other metrics from trackers like Apple Health, Oura, and Garmin to help offer personalized insights on how they can take better care of their health. Clark said there is a collective agreement that women’s health is a space ripe for innovation, and that women want to be founders, want to be top voices, and are tired of being in the back seats of their own lives. Clark officially launched a free version of her product in May and is gearing up to launch the premium offering in October, for Mental Health Awareness Month and Menopause Awareness Month. She started doing focus groups at Arizona State University and found that women in their late 30s to early 50s were reporting a lot of brain fog and mental fatigue, but it often took them until their 60s to realize it had to do with hormonal fluctuations, menopause, or even an onset of something deeper. It was here that Clark realized she wanted to focus on this age range. “They’re often dismissed or misdiagnosed when symptoms like brain fog, mood shifts, or irregular cycles first appear,” she said of women in their 30s to 50s, adding that these midlife years are critical to brain health, but traditional care is failing to connect the dots. “We’re addressing that gap. Helping women recognize and act on early signals before they escalate into more serious health challenges later,” she said. Arizona is also where the inspiration for the company’s name came from. She became fascinated with the cacti, how they stand despite the heat and produce healthy fruit. “That’s when Prickly Pear came to life because that’s the fruit that grows in the cactus tree, and it was an inspiration of thriving in harsh conditions and joyful resilience,” she said. She considers competitors in her same field to be existing menopause apps, which, she said, are more like symptom trackers. “We believe it’s important to understand symptoms, but we believe that those approaches are reactive approaches, while for us, we are there to be able to detect things.” She raised a $350,000 pre-seed round and said it was “really hard,” especially as a woman of color. “We had to be so good that you cannot be ignored,” she said. She sought to build relationships with investors before starting her pre-seed, which, she said, really helped when it came time for the ask. “That’s a popular thing we say: ‘Ask for advice and you get business, ask for business and you get advice sometimes,’” she said. Some advice she received was to apply for Startup Battlefield, with friends telling her to be loud and proud about being part of the latest startups to pitch during the competition. “Disrupt is the ultimate stage for new ideas,” she said. She’s excited to spotlight women’s brain health, learn from other founders, and, of course, “connect with investors and partners who believe, like we do, that women’s health innovation is not niche, it’s the future of healthcare.” If you want to learn from Prickly Pear firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year’s Disrupt , held October 27 to 29 in San Francisco.

Deta’s Surf app is an amalgamation of an AI browser and NotebookLM,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/detas-surf-app-is-an-amalgamation-of-an-ai-browser-and-notebooklm/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T08:00:00-07:00,"We have reached a place in the AI lifecycle where we’re seeing a lot of “X meets Y” applications. Multiple companies are already releasing “AI meets TikTok” apps, for instance. Now, Berlin- and New York-based startup Deta is marrying AI browsers and something like Google’s NotebookLM in a new knowledge management app called Surf. Deta Surf , which is launching in beta today, is both a browser and a research tool that allows you to create notebooks on different topics. You can use AI to get a gist of a certain topic based on your prompt. You’ll then get a summary report on a topic in a Notion-styled document, which you can edit. Since the core application is a browser, you can open URLs and surf the web. While browsing, you can summarize and extract key insights from web pages, PDFs, and YouTube videos. Users can mention multiple tabs to the AI chatbot, using them as context, and ask questions around them. Additionally, Deta Surf can generate code, so you can ask the tool to create mini apps, interactive graphs, or charts for your notebook. You can also add any of the output from AI to a particular notebook. Most modern-day AI-browsers like Perplexity’s Comet , The Browser Company’s Dia , and Opera Neon allow users to use tabs as context. And a few of them also have the ability to generate small snippets of code. Deta, which was founded in 2019, set out to build a new operating system using an infinite white canvas . However, the company sunset the product in 2023 , and started working on an AI browser. The company’s co-founder, Max Eusterbrock, said that the company explored different interfaces for a browser, but realized that pursuing this direction was a bad idea. “We were in Alpha for a year. During that time, we realized that AI browsers are landing in the spot where they are fundamentally becoming tools for machines to click around and navigate hypertext that is meant for humans,” he said. Eusterbrock added that the startup also thinks that an interface where you can’t edit anything is not a great design for human-machine interaction. While the product functions much like a browser, the startup thinks NotebookLM is a direct competitor. Eusterbrock believes that because Surf provides you with context with tabs and keeps the data locally to let you work offline on the notebooks, it’s a better-suited product for students and researchers. The company has made the tool available for free and is working on an image generation feature. Going forward, it may work toward a premium subscription that would include features like cloud backup, collaboration, and multi-device clients. In 2023, Deta raised $3.6 million in a seed round led by Crane Venture Partners with participation from System.One, Tomahawk.VC, Tiny.VC, Acequia Capital, Angel Invest, and NPHard. Since then, the company has raised an additional $500,000 in funding from existing and new investors.

Kevin Hart’s VC firm leads $35M Series B for weight-loss app Simple,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/kevin-harts-vc-firm-leads-35m-series-b-for-weight-loss-app-simple/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T07:55:00-07:00,"Mike Prytkov said he knows what it’s like to let stress take over one’s life. While building his first company, he said he worked long hours and gained weight. After exiting his company (an adtech company called Appness), he said he tried many things to lose the pounds: extreme workouts, calorie tracking, and fasting. “While it worked, consistency was the hard part,” he told TechCrunch. What he really wanted was a coach who would keep him accountable, he said. So in 2019, he launched Simple , an AI-powered health coaching app that helps people lose weight. Then, in 2023, he added its standout feature: an AI coach named Avo, which helps give tailored advice to users’ needs and progress. “We wanted to help people lose weight without the guilt or grind that is innate to the toxic diet culture,” he said. Having built the company to a current $160 million in ARR with 700,000 subscribers, he said, Simple announced on Wednesday that it closed a $35 million Series B funding round led by actor Kevin Hart’s HartBeat Ventures. The company has raised $45 million in total funding. Prytkov had an early co-founder who has since left the company, leaving him at the helm solo. Avo today handles more than 100,000 coaching conversations a day and processes nearly 300,000 daily meal logs, Prytkov said. Users fill out a form to help them build a personalized program, then they are introduced to the AI coach. It collects information, like meal logs, from user input, and it runs assessments that score habits and nutritional quality, he said. “The coaching is delivered through a chat powered by LLMs that adapt tone and content to each person, with memory for long-term context and constitution-based fine-tuning,” Prytkov added. Obviously, the app is a direct competitor to Noom, perhaps the most popular behavioral dieting app in the industry, with millions of users. And it competes with WeightWatchers and MyFitnessPal. Prytkov said it is different from its competitors because it does not offer generic lessons or generally track calories, nor has it ventured into supplying GLP-1 medications. “We provide personalized coaching, not just tracking,” he said. “Avo adapts daily plans across nutrition, fasting, movement, and habits, as it provides real-time meal feedback and tailored check-ins.” It does, however, help complement GLP-1 users and their medication, acting as a “behavior engine” that helps sustain routines after the meds stop. Although the coaching premise of the app has remained unchanged, the rise of LLMs has been a boon to personalization. “AI has changed both the product and the model,” he continued. “Every dialogue, every logged meal feeds a closed‑loop learning system that updates each person’s profile and improves our cohort‑level models,” he said. “With each iteration, Avo becomes more accurate and more proactive.” Prytkov said that HartBeat approached the company after it launched Avo two years ago. The firm already had a few health investments under its belt. “At the time, we weren’t looking for investors, but HartBeat Ventures felt like an amazing fit for us, so we agreed,” he said, adding that the app already had the metrics, profitability, and traction. Others in the round include the private credit firm Liquidity. Prytkov believes users, meanwhile, have taken to the app because it doesn’t feel clinical to them. He said virtual wellness has become the “default front door” for weight management as it’s proven affordable and accessible. Next, he wants to expand his company’s GLP-1 companion features and also launch specialized women’s health and midlife programs. Eventually, he plans to expand beyond weight loss and make a health app that can help with sleep, stress, and movement. “Our vision is to become the Duolingo of health,” Prytkov said. “The goal is simple. Become the go-to fun health companion people use every day, and the most effective way to build healthy habits.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Prytkov, Kevin Hart, Mike Prytkov, Noom, Avo, MyFitnessPal, GLP-1","ARR, cohort‑level, AI, WeightWatchers, HartBeat, TechCrunch, closed‑loop, HartBeat Ventures","$160 m, $35 m, $45 m",,AI

Former OpenAI and DeepMind researchers raise whopping $300M seed to automate science,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/former-openai-and-deepmind-researchers-raise-whopping-300m-seed-to-automate-science/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-30T11:56:59-07:00,"Periodic Labs came out of stealth on Tuesday with a war chest of $300 million as a seed round, backed by a tech industry who’s who: Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos. Periodic Labs was founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk and Liam Fedus. Cubuk led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, where one of his projects was, for instance, an AI tool called GNoME. That tool discovered over 2 million new crystals in 2023 , materials that could one day be used to power new generations of technology, researchers say. Fedus is a former VP of Research at OpenAI, and one of the researchers who helped create ChatGPT. He also led the team that created the first trillion-parameter neural network . Its small team is likewise filled with researchers who have worked on other major AI and materials science projects, from building OpenAI’s agent Operator to working on Microsoft’s MatterGen, an LLM materials science discovery AI. The goal of Periodic Labs is nothing less than to automate scientific discovery, creating AI scientists, the company says. This means building labs where robots conduct physical experiments, collect data, iterate, and try again, learning and improving as they go. The lab’s first goal is to invent new superconductors that it hopes perform better and possibly require less energy than existing superconducting materials. But the well-funded startup also hopes to find other new materials. Another goal is to collect all the physical world data that its AI scientists produce as they mix and heat and otherwise manipulate various powers and raw materials in their search for something new. “Until now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet” and LLMs have “exhausted” the internet as a source that can be consumed, the company says in an introductory blog post . “[A]t Periodic, we are building AI scientists and the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.” The hope is that, not only will the labs invent next-generation materials, but they will produce invaluable fresh data that AI models can consume to continue their evolution. While this might be one of the most impressive groups of researchers to assemble a startup for this purpose, it’s not the only one working on AI scientists. AI as a tool to automate chemistry discoveries has been a topic of academic research since at least 2023 . It is the pursuit of tiny startups like Tetsuwan Scientific , as well as nonprofits like Future House and the University of Toronto’s Acceleration Consortium .

A comprehensive list of 2025 tech layoffs,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/tech-layoffs-2025-list/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-30T09:53:59-07:00,"The tech layoff wave is still kicking in 2025. Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi . So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here . If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here .  Will eliminate around 450 jobs as part of a cost and operations review, according to Reuters. The layoffs will span multiple functions and countries, including customer service and sales. Europe’s largest food delivery company said it is increasingly using automation and AI, shifting many manual service tasks to automated systems. Plans to cut around 250 jobs , approximately 30% of its workforce, as part of a push to become a leaner, faster, and AI-focused company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Tel Aviv-headquartered freelance services marketplace said the restructuring will reduce management layers and position it to pursue growth with an AI-native approach. Is closing its Tel Aviv development center, cutting about 80 jobs . Led by Yosi Taguri, the office specialized in software, data, and AI research, including algorithm development. The California-based recruitment firm, founded in 2010, is trimming costs amid a challenging labor market. Has laid off at least 100 employees , including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, raised $60 million in equity and debt in July . Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs , according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco , just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters , according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month , around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains. Is set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location , with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to lay off 161 employees in Seattle , according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department. Is cutting 106 positions at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing.

Hance will demo its kilobyte-size AI audio-processing software at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/hance-will-demo-its-kilobyte-size-ai-audio-processing-software-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-30T09:22:28-07:00,"Imagine you’re a Formula One driver hurtling down a race track at 200 miles per hour when your engineer comes on the radio and says … something . You can’t make it out, but you’re also not going to spend a lap playing out that old Verizon commercial (“Can you hear me now?”) with the race — and your life — on the line. This is just one problem Norwegian startup Hance is solving with an impressively small and fast bit of audio-processing software that’s already attracted customers like Intel and Riedel Communications, the official radio supplier to F1. Hance is one of the 200 startups selected to show off its technology at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 , which runs October 27 through 29 at Moscone Center in San Francisco. The outfit of around 10 employees boasts a wealth of audio industry experience. That includes co-founder Stian Aagedal, who’s also the CEO of audio editing software company Acon Digital, and Peder Jørgensen, who runs the sound effects library Soundly. With artificial intelligence booming, Aagedal, Jørgensen, and the rest of the Hance team realized there was an opportunity to leverage these new technologies throughout the audio-processing pipeline — but especially in noise reduction and isolation. So a few years ago they started training their own models on Soundly’s high-quality recordings, including everything from the roar of F1 cars to the crack-and-rumble of Icelandic volcanoes. Since then, they’ve been able to shrink the Hance processing models to just 242 kB, meaning they can run on device instead of in the cloud, saving time and energy. Hance says these models can separate sounds; remove noise, echo, and reverb; and enhance speech clarity with just 10 milliseconds of latency. While other companies offer similar audio processing software, Hance’s tiny, energy-efficient models can process audio on devices of all sizes in real time. That makes it great for the radios Riedel sells to F1 or FIFA, and also attractive to law enforcement and defense applications, CEO Joote Hika told TechCrunch in an interview. Hika sees opportunity for Hance’s audio processing to go in many more directions, too, now that it has lined up Intel as a partner. Hance has been working with the technology giant to adopt its models to work on different versions of its chips, including its latest “neural processing units.” The startup is talking with other chipmakers, too, and an undisclosed smartphone maker, Hika said. Hika also said these professional partnerships will likely last at least a few years and that they’re non-exclusive. That’s good for the startup’s ability to scale, but he said Hance will have to keep developing at a rapid pace to stay ahead of the competition. The company has just brought on its first chief commercial officer, but Hika said he expects Hance to stay heavily focused on R&D and that the company will preference “AI-capable” workers to stay lean. “We know that we now have an advantage over our competitors, but we definitely have to keep that up, so we’re pushing fast,” he said If you want to learn more about Hance — and dozens of other startups, hearing their pitches and listening to guest speakers on four different stages — join us at Disrupt , taking place October 27 to 29, in San Francisco.

A new a16z report looks at which AI companies startups are actually paying for,https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/02/a-new-a16z-report-looks-at-which-ai-companies-startups-are-actually-paying-for/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-02T08:00:00-07:00,"On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with the fintech firm Mercury. Using transaction data from Mercury, the report analyzes the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are spending money on, similar to the previously published Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps . a16z partners Olivia Moore and Seema Amble say the data shows companies are still adopting a range of different AI products for certain tasks — and new apps are rising and falling very quickly. “There’s a proliferation of tools,” Amble said. “It hasn’t just coalesced around one or two in each category.” The report also shows a lot of spending on “human augmentors” or “copilots” that can help boost productivity among the workforce, suggesting startups aren’t ready to fully shift into agentic workflows. “As computer use becomes more of a mode and there’s more of the ability for there to be end-to-end agentic flows built, I think that shift will happen, where we’ll see fewer copilots and more end-to-end agent tools,” Amble said. “Especially as people are really eager to give them a try.” Unsurprisingly, the top of the list was dominated by major labs, with OpenAI taking the top slot and Anthropic following up at No. 2. Vibe-coding tools were also well represented, with Replit at No. 3 and Lovable at No. 18. Cursor landed at No. 6 and Emergent at No. 48. Cognition, which operates more enterprise-oriented coding tools like Devin and Windsurf, was at No. 34. When a16z produced a similar list for consumer habits, Lovable ranked much higher than Replit on pure traffic alone because a lot of people were using it to create projects. But startups are not spending as much money on Lovable as they are on Replit, in part because of the lack of enterprise features. But the variety of companies on the list seems to suggest there’s room for plenty of different companies at once. “It’s an open question going forward on vibe coding,” Moore said. “Does the space start to consolidate, and one place becomes the best platform to vibe code? Or is it the case where there’ll be four or five more vibe coding companies that are really big businesses for different types of applications? We don’t have the answer to that yet.” Moore was also surprised to see startups adopting consumer-oriented tools like CapCut and Midjourney. “We’re seeing that a lot of these [consumer] companies are getting yanked into enterprise faster and faster because they make such delightful consumer tools that then people adopt and use as individuals and bring into their teams and workplaces,” Moore said. Horizontal applications overall made up at least 60% of the names on the list, and 40% consisted of vertical applications. The most popular vertical software companies fell into three buckets: sales, recruiting, and customer service. But the report also found AI making progress in many sectors that previous generations of startups had struggled to crack. “What maybe previously would have been, like, service firms or consultancies are now software companies in the age of AI,” Moore said. Amble gave Crosby Legal as an example, which can quickly review a legal contract for a user, replacing what at one point would have been a meeting with an in-house general counsel, rummaging through thoughts and research. She said right now, most of the tools are used to aid employees (like a co-pilot) in making decisions faster, rather than replacing entire workforces and talent suits with automated workers (end-to-end agents). “As the tech gets better, and we’re actually able to build out full agent co-workers, you’ll see that mix shift more toward end-to-end agents and away from co-pilots,” she said, later adding that AI tools can do much more work, like outreach, faster than a human can. There were also a lot of note takers on the list, such as Otter.ai , Read AI, and HappyScribe — with no single option dominating. This is what Amble meant when she said there isn’t one product yet that has dominated the market; rather, startups are still picking “their own flavor” to see what tools they like best. This is also good for employees, who, with so many options, can pick what applications help them work best, rather than using a one-size-fits-all product “pushed down from the top,” Amble said. The last big find in the report was the increasing intertwining of consumer and enterprise businesses. People are bringing the personal applications they use at home to work, and people who have started companies are using their favorite personal applications to help build their businesses. Before, there would have been a delineation between the two: a set stack for what to use while building a startup. Amble and Moore cited Canva as an example: It’s a popular consumer app that also has a sizable enterprise audience. It took years for Canva to even add an enterprise plan. But as individual and enterprise use cases become harder to distinguish, companies are more willing to blend the two. “Your TAM [total addressable market] is no longer one or the other, but you can sell into both,” she continued. She said companies building these products might also “professionalize” faster, meaning building out enterprise teams, like go-to-market, sales, and support, so they can start selling and accruing enterprise revenue sooner, rather than depending on individual consumers. Moore and Amble are expecting the list to change quickly in the coming years. Older companies are now launching AI features to stay relevant and accessible, while new entrants arrive with new ideas. “Legacy players, legacy almost means, ‘what was 12 months ago,’” Amble said. “If we pull this again in 12 months, will the same note-taking apps even be on there? Or will there be a whole new set?” This piece was updated to reflect the note-taking apps.

"Salesforce launches enterprise vibe-coding product, Agentforce Vibes",https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/salesforce-launches-enterprise-vibe-coding-product-agentforce-vibes/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-10-01T05:00:00-07:00,"Enterprise giant Salesforce is looking to ride the vibe-coding wave — where developers describe what they want in natural language and AI agents write the code — with its new AI-powered developer tool. Salesforce announced its new vibe-coding offering, Agentforce Vibes, on Wednesday. This new coding tool helps developers work autonomously on Salesforce apps and agents by handling much of the technical implementation automatically. Agentforce Vibes can help developers from the app idea phase to building to observability with enterprise security and governance controls baked in. This new tool includes an autonomous AI coding agent named Vibe Codey. This agent is already connected to a company’s existing Salesforce account, which allows it to reuse an org’s already-written code and follow its coding guidelines, to create apps that match existing products. Dan Fernandez, the vice president of product for developer services at Salesforce, told TechCrunch that Agentforce Vibes being connected to a company’s existing Salesforce account gives enterprises the best of both worlds. They get to foray into vibe coding but without the potential security issues and without having to start each project from scratch. “We’re trying to give you everything,” Fernandez said. “So rather than having to spend a bunch of time on setting up [model context protocols — systems that let AI models securely communicate with external tools and data], setting up a dev environment, setting up tools, everything’s prebuilt and ready for you, including AI requests to get started. And that really is sort of a differentiator on how we’re lowering the barrier to entry.” This isn’t Salesforce’s first foray into vibe coding, Fernandez said, but rather the latest addition to its suite of AI developer tools. Salesforce first released an AI-powered code building tool back in 2023. Last year, the company announced the general availability of Agentforce for developers at its Dreamforce conference. Now everything is coming together. “[We are] taking the power of the client tools and Agentforce for developers and making it tailored to Salesforce development,” Fernandez said. “It really is that end-to-end experience for having an enterprise vibe coding for the agentic enterprise.” These new capabilities are built on a fork from open source AI coding agent Cline’s Visual Studio Code Extension . Fernandez said the company tried a lot of different open source coding tools before deciding to go with Cline partially due to its strong support of MCP, or the ability for AI models to securely communicate with external tools and data. This release comes at an interesting time for the vibe-coding industry. Many vibe-coding startups are continuing to raise large funding rounds at eye-watering valuations from investors. Vibe-coding startup Lovable, for example, is allegedly turning down unsolicited funding offers from investors after garnering a $1.8 billion valuation just eight months after launching. Vibe-coding startup Anything recently claimed to hit $2 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just two weeks after launching. Despite the hype, the long-term success of these platforms is less clear. Due to the sheer volume of large language model usage required to run these platforms, costs for these companies are high and resulting margins are tight, TechCrunch reported in August . However, these cost pressures matter less when vibe coding is baked into a larger product suite as Salesforce’s Agentforce Vibes is. Each Salesforce organization gets 50 requests per org per day using OpenAI’s GPT-5 model with additional requests after that going through a Salesforce-hosted Qwen 3.0 model. The company is currently offering Agentforce Vibes for free to its existing users with priced usage plans expected in the future.

AI recruiter Alex raises $17M to automate initial job interviews,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/ai-recruiter-alex-raises-17m-to-automate-initial-job-interviews/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-29T13:32:35-07:00,"Job seekers in all fields can expect to soon be doing a lot more initial screening interviews. While that may sound like positive news, it doesn’t mean that there will suddenly be more open positions. Instead, recruiters, often bogged down with determining which applicants are qualified for the next round, will outsource the routine screening tasks — like checking backgrounds, salary needs, and availability — to (you guessed it) AI. Alex , a startup building an AI recruiter, says it’s already helping companies conduct video interviews and phone screens. Aaron Wang (pictured center, bottom row), who co-founded Alex about 18 months ago, told TechCrunch that the startup’s voice AI tool can conduct autonomous interviews with applicants soon after they apply for a job. “Our AI recruiter does thousands of interviews a day and helps people get hired at some of the biggest companies in the world,” he said. Although Wang, who previously worked at Facebook and spent time as a quant for a hedge fund, declined to name customers, he said they include Fortune 100 companies, financial institutions, nationwide restaurant chains, and Big 4 accounting firms. Investors view the rise of AI interviewers as a trend that many companies will inevitably adopt. That conviction led to Alex’s new $17 million Series A round, which was led by Peak XV Partners. The round included participation from Y Combinator and Uncorrelated Ventures, along with several chief human resources officers (CHROs) from unnamed Fortune 500 companies, and others. This Series A follows the company’s $3 million seed funding, which was led by 1984 Ventures last year. Alex isn’t alone in offering AI recruiting services to companies. The startup’s competitors include other early-stage companies like HeyMilo, ConverzAI, and Ribbon. Mercor, the rapidly growing AI data labeling startup that we reported is attempting to raise a new round at a $10 billion valuation , also started its life as an AI recruiter . Alex’s long-term vision is to interview millions of job applicants to build professional profile data that is richer and deeper than what LinkedIn currently offers. “Our thesis is that a 10-minute conversation with you tells me a whole lot more about you than your LinkedIn profile does,” Wang said. But for now, Alex is focused on helping recruiters free up their time to build relationships with pre-qualified candidates and advising hiring managers.

Vibe-coding startup Anything nabs a $100M valuation after hitting $2M ARR in its first two weeks,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/vibe-coding-startup-anything-nabs-a-100m-valuation-after-hitting-2m-arr-in-its-first-two-weeks/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-29T10:55:29-07:00,"It’s no secret that vibe coding — using AI-powered coding tools to build apps and websites via natural language prompts — is exploding in popularity. In July, Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just eight months after launch. It plans to close the year at $250 million ARR and thinks it will hit $1 billion ARR within the next 12 months. Meanwhile, Replit said earlier this month that its ARR soared from $2.8 million to $150 million in less than a year. These companies’ remarkable growth has fueled a wave of competitors, many of which are also quickly gaining momentum. “This is one of those spaces where every company is growing like a weed,” said Nikhil Basu Trivedi, co-founder and general partner at VC firm Footwork. However, despite their rapid growth, Lovable, Replit, and other vibe-coding startups have a significant shortcoming, argues Basu Trivedi: They excel at developing prototypes but struggle to enable users to launch production-ready software. The problem with most vibe-coding companies, Basu Trivedi says, is that they don’t provide all the infrastructure that nontechnical users need to launch a functional product. Anything , an AI app launched a month ago, is attempting to solve this problem by offering all the tools — from databases to storage and payment functionality — that users need to run businesses on the web or to send their vibe-coded creations to the App Store. The company’s initial traction was explosive, reaching $2 million annualized run rate in just two weeks. Though the vibe-coding market is crowded, the company’s growth rate is so impressive that Basu Trivedi knew he had to fund it. Anything announced on Monday that it has raised an $11 million financing round at a $100 million valuation, led by Footwork, with additional backing from Uncork, Bessemer, and M13. Co-founded by former Google colleagues Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe, Anything is particularly designed to help nontechnical people generate complete web and mobile applications. “You haven’t really seen real businesses built on top of any of these tools,” Amin said about other vibe-coding companies. “We want to be the Shopify of the space, where people build apps that make money on top of us.” Amin claims that users have already leveraged Anything to build fully functional applications available in the AppStore, including a habit tracker, a CPR training course, and a hairstyle “try-on” app. Some of these apps are even starting to make money. These users, according to Amin, can finish their app in large part because they don’t have to figure out how to set up and connect other essential tools to the prototype generated by the vibe-coding app. The idea of developing a soup-to-nuts AI-assisted app builder came to Amin and Lowe a little under a year ago. The duo has been working together since 2021. Their first offering was a bootstrapped development marketplace that used AI coding tools in conjunction with human developers. But this was before the rise of LLMs. That business was generating about $2 million in annualized run rate, but it became clear that generative AI could soon deliver apps faster and at lower costs than their marketplace model. So, in 2023, they shut down that business and started working on developing an AI-powered app-building tool. They even raised some pre-seed and seed funding from Uncork and Bessemer Venture Partners along the way. Amin and Lowe noticed that most competitive tools, including Lovable and StackBlitz ‘s Bolt , rely on the third-party database Supabase . They believed that they could differentiate Anything AI by building all the infrastructure in-house. That development took time, but it may turn out to be worth the effort because Anything is not the only startup in this market. It’s not even the only one that’s making a bet that offering all the back-end tools can be a big growth driver. Other startups that are building big chunks of their own infrastructure include Mocha and Rork , the latter of which claims to be on track to hit $10 million in ARR by the end of the year. But the intense competition doesn’t faze Basu Trivedi. “It seems there’s enough demand out there for different types of app-building products,” he said.

The AI services transformation may be harder than VCs think,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/28/the-ai-services-transformation-may-be-harder-than-vcs-think/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-28T18:20:12-07:00,"Venture capitalists have convinced themselves they’ve found the next big investing edge: using AI to wring software-like margins out of traditionally labor-intensive services businesses. The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies. Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether. “Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said Marc Bhargava , who leads GC’s related efforts, in a recent interview with TechCrunch . “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” If you can automate services business, too, he said — tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers — the math begins to look irresistible. The game plan seems to be working right now. Take Titan MSP , one of GC’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy. Similarly, the firm incubated Eudia , which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Cargill, Del Monte, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hana, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach. GC looks to double — at least — the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained. The powerhouse firm isn’t alone in its thinking. The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments, including Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company, then grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders. “If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, told TechCrunch this summer . “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.” Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an interview with TechCrunch this spring . But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be more complicated than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” — AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues. The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first decipher it, then decide whether or not to send it back, and oftentimes just to fix it themselves. Based on those participants’ estimates of time spent, along with their self-reported salaries, the authors of the survey estimate that workslop carries an invisible tax of $186 per month per person. “For an organization of 10,000 workers, given the estimated prevalence of workslop . . . this yields over $9 million per year in lost productivity ,” they write in a new Harvard Business Review article. Bhargava disputed the notion that AI is overhyped, arguing instead that all these implementation failures actually validate GC’s approach. “I think it kind of shows the opportunity, which is, it’s not easy to apply AI technology to these businesses,” he said. “If all the Fortune 100 and all these folks could just bring in a consulting firm, slap on some AI, get a contract with OpenAI, and transform their business, then obviously our thesis [would be] a little bit less robust. But the reality is, it’s really hard to transform a company with AI.” He pointed to the technical sophistication required in AI as the most critical missing puzzle piece. “There’s a lot of different technology. It’s good at different things,” he said. “You really need these applied AI engineers from places like Rippling and Ramp and Figma and Scale, who have worked with the different models, understand their nuances, understand which ones are good for what, understand how to wrap it in software.” That complexity is exactly why GC’s strategy of pairing AI specialists with industry experts to build companies from the ground up makes sense, he argued. Still, there’s no denying that workslop threatens to undermine — to some extent — the strategy’s core economics. Even if a holding company is created as a starting point, if the acquired companies reduce staff as the AI efficiency thesis suggests they should, they’ll have fewer people available to catch and correct AI-generated errors. If the companies maintain current staffing levels to handle the additional work created by problematic AI output, the huge margin gains that VCs are counting on might never be realized. Arguably, these scenarios should perhaps slow the scaling plans that are central to the VCs’ roll-up strategies and that potentially undermine the numbers that make these deals attractive to them. But let’s face it; it will take more than a study or two to slow down most Silicon Valley investors. In fact, because they typically acquire businesses with existing cash flow, GC says its “creation strategy” companies are already profitable — a marked departure from the traditional VC playbook of backing high-growth, cash-burning startups. It’s also likely a welcome change for the limited partners behind venture firms, who have bankrolled years of losses at companies that never reached profitability. “As long as AI technology continues to improve, and we see this massive investment and improvement in the models,” Bhargava said, “I think there’ll just be more and more industries for us to help incubate companies.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Ramp, Stripe, Johnson Hana, Bhargava, Marc Bhargava, Elad Gil, Gil, BetterUp Labs, Gruve","Stanford Social Media Lab, Figma, AI, Eudia, Harvard Business Review, GC, General Catalyst, Mayfield, OpenAI, Rippling, TechCrunch, MSP, Cargill","$1.5 b, $16 , $1 , $74 m, $100 m, $5 m, $15 m, $186 , $9 m",,AI
Famed roboticist says humanoid robot bubble is doomed to burst,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/famed-roboticist-says-humanoid-robot-bubble-is-doomed-to-burst/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-26T23:45:54-07:00,"Renowned roboticist Rodney Brooks has a wake-up call for investors funneling billions into humanoid robot startups: You’re wasting your money. Brooks, who co-founded iRobot and spent decades at MIT, is particularly skeptical of companies like Tesla and the high-profile AI robotics company Figure trying to teach robots dexterity by showing them videos of humans doing tasks. In a new essay , he calls this approach “pure fantasy thinking.” The problem? Human hands are incredibly sophisticated, packed with about 17,000 specialized touch receptors that no robot comes close to matching. While machine learning transformed speech recognition and image processing, those breakthroughs were built on decades of existing technology for capturing the right data. “We don’t have such a tradition for touch data,” Brooks points out. Then there’s safety. Full-sized walking humanoid robots pump massive amounts of energy into staying upright. When they fall, they’re dangerous. Physics means a robot twice the size of today’s models would pack eight times the harmful energy. Brooks predicts that in 15 years, successful “humanoid” robots will actually have wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors and abandon the human form. Meanwhile, he’s thoroughly convinced that today’s billions are funding expensive training experiments that will never scale to mass production. It’s far from the first time Brooks has poured cold water on expectations set by brash entrepreneurs and eager investors. Last year, he talked at length with TechCrunch about why the promise of generative AI exceeds its abilities and can even create more work in some cases. For example, the AI research nonprofit METR said this summer it had recruited 16 highly rated developers from large open source repositories to measure the impacts of AI tools on real-world software development. It then assigned them nearly 250 real issues to address with the tools and without them, and measured their screens. When the developers used the AI tools, they took 19% longer to complete their tasks. As interestingly, they perceived that the AI had sped them up by 20%. Brooks has also long argued that AI is not the existential threat that many, including Elon Musk, have posited that it is. TechCrunch talked with Brooks about this back in 2017 at MIT, when the landscape looked very different but not entirely dissimilar to today’s playing field. At the time, Brooks said he was just starting to see more companies specializing in making datasets for machine learning — a trend that has only continued. Relatedly, he argued why it wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion that Big Tech companies would win in robotics, despite what long ago seemed an insurmountable lead in the amount of data they control. Yet today’s leading robotics companies have not escaped those companies’ gravitational pull. Apptronik, a humanoid robot maker that has raised nearly $450 million from investors, counts Google among its backers and partnered with Google’s DeepMind robotics team late last year to “bring together best-in-class artificial intelligence with cutting-edge hardware and embodied intelligence.” Figure, similarly, is backed in part by Microsoft and OpenAI Startup Fund and partnered with OpenAI in February 2024 to combine OpenAI’s research with its own “deep understanding of robotics hardware and software.” The two split up almost exactly a year later, this past March, with FigureAI saying it had enjoyed a “major breakthrough” in its own in-house, end-to-end AI for robotics. Earlier this month, Figure announced it had received over $1 billion in committed capital in its latest funding round and said the deal valued the company at an astonishing $39 billion .

"Spotify to label AI music, filter spam and more in AI policy change",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/spotify-updates-ai-policy-to-label-tracks-cut-down-on-spam/,Dominic-Madori Davis,2025-09-25T05:00:00-07:00,"Spotify on Thursday announced a series of updates to its AI policy, designed to better indicate when AI is being used to make music, to cut down on spam, and to make it clearer that unauthorized voice clones are not permitted on its service. The company says it will adopt an industry standard for identifying and labeling AI music in credits, known as DDEX , and will soon roll out a new music spam filter to catch more bad actors. Under the DDEX system, labels, distributors, and music partners submit standardized AI disclosures in music credits. This solution offers detailed information about the use of AI — like whether it was used for AI-generated vocals, instrumentation, or post-production, for example. “We know the use of AI is going to be a spectrum, with artists and producers incorporating AI in various parts of their creative workflow,” said Sam Duboff, Spotify’s Global Head of Marketing and Policy, in a press briefing on Wednesday. “This industry standard will allow for more accurate, nuanced disclosures. It won’t force tracks into a false binary where a song either has to be categorically AI or not AI at all,” he noted. As part of the same announcement, Spotify clarified its polices around AI-enabled personalization, stating directly thatunauthorized AI voice clones, deepfakes, and any other form of vocal replicas or impersonation are not allowed and will be removed from the platform. While the DDEX standard is developing, Spotify says it’s received commitments from 15 labels and distributors who plan to adopt the technology, and sees its move as one that could signal to others it’s time to adopt the technology. Because AI tools make it easier for anyone to release music, Spotify also has a new plan to cut down on the potential spam that results. This fall, the company will roll out a new music spam filter that will attempt to address spam tactics, tag them, and then stop recommending those tracks to users. “We know AI has made it easier than ever for bad actors to mass upload content, create duplicates, use SEO tricks to manipulate search or recommendation systems…we’ve been fighting these kinds of tactics for years,” Duboff said. “But AI is accelerating these issues with more sophistication, and we know that requires new types of mitigations.” The company said it would roll out the filter gradually to make sure it’s targeting the right signals, then add more signals over time as the market evolves. Related to this, Spotify will also work with distributors to address something called “profile mismatches,” a scheme where someone fraudulently uploads music to another artist’s profile across streaming services. The company said it hopes to prevent more of these before the music ever goes live. Despite the changes, Spotify executives emphasized that they still support use of AI provided it’s used in a non-fraudulent way. “We’re not here to punish artists for using AI authentically and responsibly. We hope that artists’ use of AI production tools will enable them to be more creative than ever,” noted Spotify VP and Global Head of Music, Charlie Hellman. “But we are here to stop the bad actors who are gaming the system, and we can only benefit from all that good side of AI if we aggressively protect against the downside,” he said. Spotify’s updates follow a rapid increase in AI-generated music across the industry. This summer, an AI-generated band called Velvet Sundown went viral on its service, leading users to complain that the company isn’t transparent about labeling its AI tracks. Meanwhile, streaming rival Deezer recently shared that about 18% of the music uploaded each day to its service — or more than 20,000 tracks — is now fully AI-generated. (Deezer tells us that figure has now increased to over 30,000). Spotify wouldn’t share its own metrics on the matter directly — but Duboff told reporters that “the reality is, all streaming services have almost exactly the same catalog.” “People tend to deliver the music to all services,” he explained, adding that uploading tracks doesn’t mean anyone’s listening or that the AI music makes money. “We know AI usage is increasingly not a binary, but kind of a spectrum of how artists and producers are using it.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Charlie Hellman, Sam Duboff, Duboff, Deezer","Spotify, Velvet Sundown, AI, SEO, Global Head of Music, Spotify VP, Deezer, TechCrunch",,,"AI, GAMING"
