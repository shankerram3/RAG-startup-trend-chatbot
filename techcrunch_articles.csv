More executives depart Hyundai’s air taxi startup Supernal,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/more-executives-depart-hyundais-air-taxi-startup-supernal/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-26T10:45:00-07:00,"A wider leadership shake-up at Hyundai’s electric air taxi startup Supernal is underway just a few weeks after it paused work on its vehicle program and its CEO and CTO left, TechCrunch has learned. Supernal’s chief strategy officer, Jaeyong Song, and chief safety officer, Tracy Lamb, are no longer with the company, the startup confirmed Friday. Lina Yang, the chief of staff to Supernal’s recently departed CEO, Jaiwon Shin, is also out. (Yang had previously served as Supernal’s “Head of Intelligent Systems” until April 2025.) “As we transition to new leadership, we have taken the opportunity to strategically review our program’s progress and next steps to ensure alignment with our long-term goals,” the startup said in a statement to TechCrunch. Supernal said owner Hyundai Motor Group “remains strongly committed to its AAM [advanced air mobility] business.” Song’s departure is particularly notable given that he spent three years serving as the vice president of Hyundai’s AAM group before taking over the chief strategy officer role at Supernal in 2023. (Supernal was spun out of AAM in 2021.) Song has been employed by the larger Hyundai-Kia group since 2014. Lamb, meanwhile, has a long history as a commercial pilot and safety executive in the aerospace industry. Song didn’t immediately responded to a request for comment. Lamb declined to comment. It’s been a tough year for Supernal. That startup ended 2024 by abruptly winding down its new headquarters in Washington, D.C., as TechCrunch previously reported . While Supernal finally pulled off its first test flight in March, it laid off dozens of employees just a few months later. By early September, the startup began an executive shake-up and paused the air taxi program. This is happening at a crucial moment for the nascent electric vertical takeoff and landing industry. Some players are securing investment and new partnerships ahead of planned commercial launches (all while the regulatory scheme gets increasingly favorable in the U.S.), while others are going out of business.

TruSources to show off its on-device identity-checking tech at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/trusources-to-show-off-its-on-device-identity-checking-tech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-26T09:09:41-07:00,"For years, “know your customer” checks have become commonplace on the internet, often by way of sharing a copy of your government-issued ID and a selfie to confirm that it’s really you, to access a website or app, or to purchase certain goods. Nowadays, age-verification laws taking effect across the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, and beyond are also giving rise to an entire industry of ID-checking companies charged with granting you access to the “adult” web. But uploading your identity details and selfie to a company’s servers has long had privacy advocates spooked and fearful that this sensitive information could be monetized, lost, or stolen in a data breach. A new startup called TruSources aims to solve some of these privacy and security challenges by performing age-verification and identity checks on a person’s device, without the person’s sensitive information ever leaving their phone. The company is part of Startup Battlefield and plans to show off its new technology at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 , which runs October 27 through 29 at Moscone West in San Francisco. TruSources’ founder and chief technology officer, Sanjay Krishnamurthy, who worked on the core encryption engine at WhatsApp, tells TechCrunch that he worked on his technology initially to help prevent scams, many of which rely on duping unsuspecting victims into handing over their sensitive information that the scammers use to cash in. His company developed a deepfake-detection app and a “know your customer” (KYC) app, which can be used to verify a user’s liveness on-device in a few seconds. Krishnamurthy says that when a user verifies their identity with TruSources, none of their information is uploaded to its servers like most age- and identity-checking companies do. Instead, TruSources’ technology relies on a custom machine learning model baked into its apps that detects patterns from an existing dataset that the company developed to spot deepfakes and false identity cards. TruSources’ technology can be integrated with other apps and websites that have to comply with age-verification laws. The technology can also be integrated into corporate single-sign-on services, which allow employees to access multiple work apps with just one set of credentials. The apps can also produce a QR code for use in the real world, such as when proving a person’s age to enter a bar without having to give over a physical copy of their identity documents. Krishnamurthy said his technology will help companies that are subject to age-verification and identity checks to be compliant with KYC rules, while both protecting those companies from having to collect people’s government-issued identity documents and preserving users’ privacy. “A handful of countries have mandated that all apps need to know your age, and they’ve made a huge problem because they don’t want to take the IDs from all over the world and there’s all kinds of legal implications,” Krishnamurthy tells TechCrunch. TruSources is still in its early days but stands out as one of the few startups tackling identity checks and age verification but without compromising a person’s privacy or security.

IPO-bound Flipkart gains key approvals to relocate to India,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/26/ipo-bound-flipkart-gains-key-approvals-to-relocate-to-india/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-26T08:11:05-07:00,"Flipkart is in the advanced stages of securing regulatory approvals to shift its headquarters from Singapore to India, with the transition targeted for later this year, TechCrunch has learned, as the Walmart-owned e-commerce giant prepares for an Indian IPO next year. The redomiciling process has received in-principle approvals from a Singapore court, while several hearings have already taken place at India’s National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Flipkart is working toward completing the transition within the next couple of months, aligning with India’s festive season — a critical sales period — and laying the groundwork for a public listing expected as early as 2026. Relocating their base back home helps companies align with evolving local regulations and meet requirements for domestic stock listings. It also makes sense to tap India’s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs. The trend reflects the growing maturity and attractiveness of India’s capital markets compared to overseas alternatives. Flipkart initiated the process in India and Singapore simultaneously over two and a half months ago, following the board’s approval for the relocation of its headquarters in April, the people said. In 2022, Walmart-backed PhonePe, which had split from Flipkart in late 2022, relocated its headquarters from Singapore to India. The fintech firm filed confidential IPO papers with India’s market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), earlier this week. Recent reports suggest that PhonePe is aiming to raise ₹120 billion (approximately $1.35 billion) through the offering. Startups including Zepto and Groww have also relocated their headquarters to India in recent months as they prepare to go public on Indian stock exchanges. Notably, Groww is set to become the first Indian startup to list domestically after redomiciling from the U.S., with its IPO expected later this year. Flipkart’s shift from its Singapore headquarters comes over a year after it raised $350 million from Google as part of a nearly $1 billion funding round that began in 2023. The company was valued at $36 billion in its most recent investment, making it the most valuable startup to undertake a redomiciling process. Flipkart did not respond to requests for comments.

Startup founders say Trump’s $100K H-1B fee is a ‘talent tariff’ that will hurt innovation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/startup-founders-say-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-is-a-talent-tariff-that-will-hurt-innovation/,Unknown,2025-09-25T12:28:18-07:00,"Amr Awadallah, founder of AI startup Vectara, had two reactions when he heard about changes to the H-1B visa program that raise the application fee for each visa to $100,000 . He was not surprised. But he was dismayed. “I can’t afford to pay $100,000,” Awadallah told TechCrunch. He’s hired one employee on an H-1B, and while the new fee only applies to new applications, he believes it’s too high for many startups and will price them out of hiring internationally. The H-1B visa was created to allow companies to hire skilled talent from a worldwide market for such occupations as IT and engineering. On Friday, Trump announced that the fee hike, typically paid by the employer, would increase from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application, a change that will especially be felt with the new batch of visas available in March. Immigration is a key issue for President Trump, who, even dating back to his 2016 campaign run, accused companies of using the H-1B to take jobs from U.S. citizens. Critics of the fee hike note that this visa helped bring in people who have gone on to start or run multibillion-dollar companies. Former holders include Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk. The visa has been more accessible than the O-1 visa for extraordinary ability, and quicker to obtain than a green card. “The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses,” Awadallah said. While Big Tech can more easily afford such fees, he feels that startups will miss out. Pricing startups out, he said, “will impact innovation in very, very negative ways longer term.” More than 700,000 people live in the U.S. on an H-1B , and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses (who are permitted to work under this visa) and children, according to the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group fwd.us. Indian nationals are the largest recipients of the visa, followed by China and the rest of the world, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Only 85,000 new people a year can receive the visa (20,000 of them must have just graduated from a U.S. university), and demand outstrips availability, so H-1Bs are allocated at random, in a lottery held in March. Tech companies have lobbied for years for an increase in annual H-1B limits. Critics allege that these companies are using H-1B holders to replace U.S. workers with lower-paid employees from overseas. Others say it exploits foreign workers, as the visa is tied to the employer, so workers can’t easily switch jobs and they face deportation if they lose their jobs. Those who support the visa fee hike said that it could eliminate the lottery because the costs are now so high that employers would limit their applications. Of the 85,000 new H-1B visas issued each year, about 55,000 go to computer-related jobs, according to business marketplace DesignRush , which shared data with TechCrunch. Previously, the total cost of hiring these workers fell between $200 million and $400 million, but under the new fee, it would cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year to hire H-1B tech workers. Under the proposed changes, the minimum salary employers must pay an H-1B recipient will also increase, a change touted to help prevent the undercutting of U.S. citizen worker salaries. But many questions still loom. For instance, Sophie Alcorn, an immigration lawyer who works with startups, said it’s unclear whether the $100,000 would be returned to the payer if an application is denied. As the price hike technically went into effect on Friday, it’s also unclear if visa petitions currently under review are subject to it. “This is forcing us to pause, hopefully temporarily, numerous H-1B petitions for aspiring founders,” she said. “We’re waiting for more guidance.” Silicon Valley founders say they look worldwide because there is a shortage of technical talent in the U.S. , especially for skills like AI engineering. Brian Sathianathan, co-founder and CTO of the AI company Iterate, has a handful of employees on the visa and credits the visa for his previous successful startup exit. “My last company I co-founded and sold, my co-founder was on an H-1B visa. My head of engineering was on an H-1B visa,” Sathianathan said. With such high fees for the visa application, that “would not have been possible.” Other founders warn that the fee sends a signal that foreign talent might not be welcomed. Hemant Mohapatra, an India-based partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, was on an H-1B for around 15 years. He said expensive barriers for tech-worker visas could leave an innovation gap in the U.S. startup ecosystem because a large percentage of unicorns and decacorns are actually founded by immigrants. Many times, he said, people brought to the U.S. on an H-1B visa later go on to start their own U.S. companies. Sometimes, their children grow up to be founders, too. That’s the experience of Jeffrey Wang, the co-founder of AI company Exa.ai. While a few of his workers obtained H-1B visas from a previous employer, Wang’s parents immigrated to the U.S. as H-1B recipients. “I heard the news and was like this makes me kind of sad,” he told TechCrunch. “I feel like people like my parents wouldn’t be able to come to America anymore.” The Trump administration said the visa change was to protect national interests, but Wang believes bringing the best talent to the U.S. helps with the nation’s security. As a nation of immigrants, nearly every important engineering or scientific achievement in the U.S. has involved immigrants, he said. U.S. startups are now scrambling. Some want exceptions carved out for startups. The administration said exemptions were possible in cases of national interest. Meanwhile, Casium , a business immigration service provider, told TechCrunch it’s seen a more than 50% increase in early-stage founders looking at O-1 visas (though spouses can’t work on this visa). Later-stage companies are looking at the EB-1A visa, typically given to those at the top of their fields, and spouses are permitted to work. Jack Thorogood, the CEO and founder of payroll company Native Teams, said his company has tracked a 50% increase in U.S. companies exploring visa-free global hiring options, like international remote work. Native Teams, which works with over 3,000 companies in 85 countries, said that one H-1B hire will now equal up to 20 remote hires in many other countries. He believes U.S. startups will just start outsourcing talent or keeping their workers abroad. “It wouldn’t be any more expensive to have talent overseas anyway,” Thorogood said. Markets like Canada, Germany, and the U.K. are already burgeoning tech hubs serving as landing spots for companies opening international offices. “If the U.S. is raising barriers, the U.K. and others should adapt accordingly to harness the amazing talent that exists from all corners of the world,” Oliver Kent-Braham, CEO and co-founder of the U.K.-based unicorn Marshmallow, told TechCrunch. Canadian Daniel Wigdor, founder of an AI venture studio and professor at the University of Toronto, agreed that the visa fee change wasn’t a good step for the U.S. “Instead of competing for the world’s best, they’re testing how much companies will pay to import them,” he said. “That stance might play domestically, but it risks undercutting America’s global tech dominance.” This piece was updated to reflect the proper title of Daniel Wigdor and the spelling of Casium’s name.

Juicebox raises $30M from Sequoia to revolutionize hiring with LLM-powered search,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/juicebox-raises-30m-from-sequoia-to-revolutionize-hiring-with-llm-powered-search/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-25T09:31:13-07:00,"For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job. David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built Juicebox , an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates. After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity. In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia. Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do. Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn’s interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia’s internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup’s growth potential. When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed. “I’m not sure I’ve ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch. Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team. Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities. What sets Juicebox’s search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would. “We help find net new candidates that wouldn’t be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we’d expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch. The startup’s product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires. Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls. While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like Eightfold are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings. Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup’s technology stack. “We’ve invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it’s] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","David Paffenholz, Gupta, Ramp, Y Combinator, Cahn, David Cahn, Stripe, Juicebox, Ishan Gupta, PeopleGPT","Paffenholz, TechCrunch, AI, Sequoia, Perplexity, ARR, Cahn, Cognition","$10 m, $36 m, $30 m","recruiting, hiring, hiring",AI
Steph Curry’s VC firm just backed an AI startup that wants to fix food supply chains,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/steph-currys-vc-firm-just-backed-an-ai-startup-that-wants-to-fix-food-supply-chains/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-25T09:30:04-07:00,"Food supply chains are notoriously messy. Orders arrive through different channels, staff spend hours manually entering them into clunky enterprise software systems, and compliance often depends on spreadsheets. For decades, software vendors have tried, with mixed success, to modernize the workflows behind the global movement of perishable goods. Now, a Y Combinator startup called Burnt thinks AI agents — software that can automatically handle tasks typically done by humans — can succeed where traditional enterprise software hasn’t in the trillion-dollar U.S. food market . The company, which automates back-office supply chain tasks with AI, has raised $3.8 million in seed funding led by Penny Jar Capital, the venture firm backed by NBA star Steph Curry, with participation from Scribble Ventures, Formation VC, and angel investors, including Dan Scheinman. Burnt co-founder and CEO Joseph Jacob grew up around food factories. He says his great-grandfather was the first to export shrimp from India to the U.S. in the 1930s. Since then, each generation of his family has worked somewhere along the seafood supply chain, including farming, processing, exporting, and importing. Jacob moved to India during his formative years and, after college, worked on the factory floor of a shrimp processor in a rural area. The experience introduced him to the intricacies of the food and restaurant business. When he returned to the U.S. and began managing large volumes of seafood imports, he noticed major inefficiencies. “I ended up buying hundreds of millions of pounds of seafood, but everything was tracked on Excel sheets and a 20-year-old ERP system,” Jacob told TechCrunch. “In a business with razor-thin margins, it’s nearly impossible to succeed without good supply chain management. We went through multiple software implementations, but two rollouts failed. That’s when I realized I wanted to build software for this industry, not just work in it.” Jacob’s experience isn’t an isolated one. Enterprise vendors have long tried to sell distributors on large rollouts that drag on for years, cost millions, and frustrate the small and mid-sized players that dominate the market. After two decades of missed software adoption in the industry, Jacob believes Burnt’s approach of layering AI agents on top of existing systems rather than replacing them represents a massive opportunity. “Everyone we talk to calls their ERP a necessary evil,” said the chief executive. “Traditional software forced teams to rip out old processes and adopt new ones. With AI, you don’t need to change the process; you just get the work done.” Here’s how things tend to work today: Sales reps at food distributors receive orders via email, phone calls, WhatsApp, voicemails, texts, and even faxes. Each order then has to be keyed in manually. While critical, the process eats up hours that could be spent on higher-value work like winning new customers or upselling existing ones. Burnt’s first agent, Ozai, automates and manages this order-entry process. In fact, Jacob claims it can handle up to 80% of workflows that are currently stuck in legacy systems. Since launching in January, the startup has processed more than $10 million in monthly orders across seafood, specialty goods, and packaged food distributors. One of the U.K.’s largest food conglomerates, with billions in revenue, is currently implementing Burnt’s system. The company is already generating six-figure revenue and growing “steadily” month-on-month, though Jacob declined to share exact numbers. While building AI for food supply chains may sound unglamorous, Jacob says that’s the point. He argues that decades of failed tech rollouts have left operators skeptical of “tech tourists” with no industry experience. His background, as well as that of his co-founders, has helped Burnt gain trust in a sector where relationships matter. Chief Product Officer Rhea Karimpanal — Jacob’s childhood friend and now wife — comes from a family that ran restaurants, while CTO Chandru Shanmugasundaram built software systems for restaurant applications. Jacob previously worked at Rekki, a Benchmark-backed B2B marketplace for restaurants and suppliers, where he saw firsthand how brittle supply chain tech could be and how AI might transform it. Still, winning investors wasn’t straightforward. AI agents may be hot, but convincing VCs to back one for food distributors required a different pitch. Many lacked conviction in the market despite its size, he said. That’s where Curry’s Penny Jar Capital came in. The firm’s thesis is centered on backing founders who are building in “overlooked” industries where tech adoption lags. “Two decades of missed software adoption is a massive opportunity. Investors who understand this know it can be huge if executed right,” Jacob said.

Doorstep raises $8M seed to help find missing food deliveries,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/doorstep-raises-8m-seed-to-help-find-missing-food-deliveries/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-25T08:00:00-07:00,"One day, Shashwat Murarka sat in his college apartment thinking about his relationship with food delivery. Sometimes, the order never arrived, and he had to wander through his apartment building, looking for the misplaced food. Other times, he found himself giving step-by-step directions to confused deliverers who, it seemed, were just as annoyed as he. “What started as frustration turned into a mission to fix one of the most overlooked problems in the supply chain, the final stretch of the last mile,” he told TechCrunch. He started studying the delivery supply chain, ran deliveries himself, and decided during his senior year in college to go all in on the problem. He teamed up with his friend Sheel Patel and launched Doorstep to help with delivery tracking. Murarka, who is CEO, said that standard GPS works wonders outdoors, but fails inside buildings, which creates a blind spot for deliverers. Doorstep integrates into existing delivery apps and then, using phone sensors, tracks when a driver has entered a building, gone up an elevator, and made it to the desired doorstep. This data is given to the delivery platform in which the driver works, like Uber Eats or DoorDash, and then can be used to automate dispute resolution and properly validate deliveries, essentially ending the drama behind missing food and blurry proof-of-delivery photos. Murarka said the company doesn’t collect driver or user information and that it maintains “the same privacy and security standards platforms already have in place.” “Our technology gives customer support teams the visibility they’ve been missing, providing real-time, verifiable data on what actually happens inside buildings to resolve refunds automatically,” Murarka said. “Solving that blind spot unlocks enormous value for platforms, drivers, merchants, and customers alike.” On Thursday, the company announced an $8 million seed round led by Canaan Partners. Murarka described fundraising as “relentless,” and said he actually slept in the office of the accelerator Antler when he first moved to New York. “Every step has been about funding the earliest believer,” he continued. “The people who don’t just want to watch the journey but want to be part of it and stay the course.” He said Doorstep raised this round in about a week and that he met their lead investor at Canaan through network connections. Others in this round include Antler, Cercano Management, Cassius, and Sean Henry, a scout at Kleiner Perkins. Murarka said the fresh capital will be used to move the technology from pilot to full production. He’s also looking to hire in engineering and product. Murarka considers the company’s competitors to be other hardware-based solutions, like standard building sensors, lockers, and cameras. “Hardware is expensive and slow to scale, while GPS simply doesn’t work indoors,” he said. The company is already active in all U.S. states, though it declined to share customers’ names. Murarka hopes his company can end the pain associated with a missing food delivery. “For me, this isn’t just about stopping fraud or refunds. It’s about rebuilding trust between platforms and customers and between drivers and the work they do,” he said. “Drivers are the backbone of delivery platforms, and having experienced those challenges ourselves, we hope to make their work easier through Doorstep.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Antler, Uber Eats, Sheel Patel, Kleiner Perkins, Shashwat Murarka, Sean Henry, Murarka","TechCrunch, Cercano Management, Antler, Doorstep, DoorDash, Canaan Partners",$8 m,,AI

Smartphone maker Nothing to spin off its affordable CMF brand,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/smartphone-maker-nothing-to-spin-off-its-affordable-cmf-brand/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T22:30:00-07:00,"Hardware startup Nothing said Thursday that it plans to make its affordable device brand, CMF, into an independent subsidiary, with India serving as its headquarters for manufacturing and R&D. The company first launched CMF in 2023 with a pair of earbuds and a smartwatch . Since then, it has introduced smartphones under the brand as well. Nothing said that it is partnering with Indian ODM (original design manufacturer) Optiemus to create a joint venture for manufacturing. While the startup didn’t reveal the ownership structure of this venture, it said that it aims to invest more than $100 million over the next three years, while creating over 1,800 jobs. The London-based startup, following its $200 million funding round led by Tiger Global , didn’t say how much money from this round will go into setting up this new venture. Nothing’s decision to choose India as CMF’s operational headquarters makes sense for a few reasons. CMF’s smartphones have been priced under $200, and that is the dominant category in India, with over 42% of phones shipped in Q2 2025 being in the $100-$200 price range, according to IDC . India has also been Nothing’s strongest market, with over 2% market share in smartphones. IDC told TechCrunch via email that Nothing was the fastest-growing brand in the country in Q2 2025, with 85% growth in shipments year over year. “India will play a key role in shaping the future of the global smartphone industry. CMF has been well-received by the market since we launched it two years ago. With our end-to-end capabilities, we are uniquely positioned to now build it into India’s first truly global smartphone brand. Our joint venture with Optiemus is a key milestone toward making that vision a reality,” Nothing’s CEO Carl Pei said in a statement. The company’s move comes after it poached Himanshu Tandon from Xiaomi’s spinoff brand POCO last month to be VP of Business for CMF. Brand spinoffs have been increasingly common in the last decade, especially for brands based in China. Examples include Xiaomi spinning off POCO , Huawei selling off Honor , and Oppo making Realme a separate company . “This move makes sense since CMF has found a market in the budget segments in both phones and wearables markets in India,” Navkendar Singh, associate VP at IDC India, told TechCrunch. “Another driver could be that Nothing wants to avoid having a value for money rub off on itself coming from CMF, especially as Nothing seems to be focused on the mid-premium end of the market [$400-$600].” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Navkendar Singh, Nothing, Himanshu Tandon, CMF, Xiaomi, Tiger Global, Carl Pei","Honor, Nothing, TechCrunch, IDC, CMF, POCO, Realme, Huawei, Xiaomi, CMF’s, VP","$100 m, $200 m, $200, $100, $200 , $400, $600",,AI
"Y Combinator launches ‘Early Decision’ for students who want to graduate first, build later",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/y-combinator-launches-early-decision-for-students-who-want-to-graduate-first-build-later/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T15:36:56-07:00,"For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and they became billionaires. That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship , which famously pays promising students $200,000 to leave college and start companies. For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox’s Drew Houston, Reddit’s Steve Huffman, and Stripe’s John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies. Now YC is changing that narrative. The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don’t want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate. For example, a student applying in fall 2025 could graduate in spring 2026, then participate in YC’s Summer 2026 batch. “It’s designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video. Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we’ve done over the past year, we’ve had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC’s most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,’ and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email. In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it’s worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford). It’s why YC’s announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the trade-offs of staying in school. The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes. The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: Do the program now or miss the opportunity. Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC’s applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there. In its announcement , YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million. YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It’s a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won’t need to choose between college and startups. They’ll do both. The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.

South Korea’s ‘Silicon Valley’ strives to live up to its global ambitions,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/south-koreas-silicon-valley-struggles-to-live-up-to-its-global-ambitions/,Unknown,2025-09-24T03:40:00-07:00,"Just south of Seoul, in the city of Seongnam, sits what many call the “Silicon Valley of South Korea”: the sprawling tech complex known as Pangyo Techno Valley (PTV), which is just a 15-minute subway ride from Gangnam, better known for its luxury boutiques, K-pop agencies, and neon nightlife in Seoul. Since launching in 2011, the 661,000-square-meter development has evolved into one of the country’s most significant innovation hubs. It’s home to more than 1,800 startups, research centers, and global tech firms, all packed into a district that feels more like a laboratory for South Korea’s future than a suburb of Seoul. Big names are everywhere in Pangyo Techno Valley, including Naver, often described as Korea’s Google, and Kakao, the country’s everything app. Gaming powerhouses Nexon and NCSoft anchor the district alongside industrial heavyweights like shipbuilder HD Hyundai and cybersecurity pioneer AhnLab. Samsung Electronics, semiconductor giant SK Hynix, and Hyundai’s autonomous vehicle division 42dot all maintain significant presences. Yet despite this concentration of tech talent and capital, industry insiders question whether Pangyo truly deserves its Silicon Valley comparison. “Pangyo is absolutely Korea’s most concentrated hub for software, gaming, platforms, and AI,” says Hyoungchul Choi, CEO of Portlogics, who founded his company there five years ago. But he’s skeptical of the Silicon Valley label. “The nickname is convenient, but we shouldn’t overstate our global influence. Silicon Valley isn’t just about density — it’s built on decades of international capital flows, ri***REMOVED*** culture, and its ability to attract talent worldwide. We’re not there yet.” The statistics back up this more modest assessment. As of a year ago, Pangyo Techno Valley was predominantly home to smaller players, with approximately 91.5% of its companies being small and midsize businesses, with Big Tech accounting for just 3.6% and the remaining 4.9% made up of public or government organizations, according to PTV’s official website . Janice Sa, a principal at Z Venture Capital, who has been working in Pangyo for more than a decade, sees the district’s influence waning. “With giants like Kakao, Naver, Nexon, and NCSoft all in one place,” the PTV’s title of Korea’s Silicon Valley “still makes sense,” she says. But compared to 10 years ago, the district doesn’t feel quite as dominant as the country’s go-to tech hub, Sa said. “Back then, startups were flocking to Pangyo. Today, many are heading back to Gangnam [in Seoul].” The reasons, she added, boil down to talent and capital. “Young developers and engineers still gravitate toward Gangnam, and most venture capital firms are packed along Teheran Street, the city’s main tech corridor lined with startups, Big Tech offices, and investors. For hiring and fundraising, that makes Gangnam the easier choice.” That exodus reflects a broader challenge. For big corporations tied to long-term leases with tax incentives, being in Pangyo isn’t much of an issue, Sa noted. But for startups competing for talent, the location can be a greater challenge. Pangyo might be only a short ride from Gangnam, but it’s still in Gyeonggi Province, not Seoul. And because government support programs are often tied to local jurisdictions, Seoul ends up with more active startup infrastructure and stronger global initiatives. An insider at a Pangyo-based tech firm, who asked not to be named, shared a similar perspective. With so many tech companies in one place, Pangyo has developed a culture that feels naturally geared toward the industry. “When you’re working in tech here, collaboration comes easier — everyone’s just around the corner,” he said. But Seoul is “more diverse. For example, Yeouido is Korea’s Wall Street, perfect for fintechs, while Gangnam draws startups of every kind.” The bigger question is whether Korean startups, regardless of location, can compete globally. Both government and private investors are pushing companies to expand internationally as the domestic market saturates. Yet breakthrough success stories remain elusive. A Kakao Ventures investor highlights cultural differences that may explain the gap. “American startups tend to succeed — and fail — much faster, which fuels constant experimentation and a high rate of talent movement. Speed is a startup’s greatest strength, so I try to have open conversations with founders about how to turn failure into opportunity,” the investor said. Storytelling is another challenge, says this investor. “Many Korean founders are sharp on numbers and strategy, but stumble on a simpler question: What’s your story? Business is still about people connecting with people. Without a clear, authentic narrative of why you and your team are the right ones, it’s hard to stand out. And because so many already bring strong skills to the table, that personal story becomes even more important,” this person said. Choi sees reason for optimism despite the challenges. The scene blends the grit of scrappy founders with the steady influence of big Korean tech companies, where stability and benefits still matter. “Unlike in the U.S., where founders often leap into risk and pivot fast, startups here tend to balance ambition with discipline — building proof at home before going abroad. The outcome is dependable engineering, but without the same ‘move fast, break things’ energy that defines Silicon Valley.” Pangyo is also moving beyond gaming and platforms into AI, biotech, and deep tech, with governments investing in startup campuses and scaling programs, Choi observed. The real test now is less about local growth and more about proving global success — unicorns, cross-border exits, and steady inflows of talent, he said. “What holds Korean startups back from going global? Three key factors are the home market is small size, weaker global investor ties, and language or regulatory hurdles that create additional friction. Breaking through takes more than ambition; it needs early global partners, deliberate go-to-market resources, and leaders who think cross-border from day one,” Choi said. Yet a fourth factor — their ability to tell compelling stories to the world — may prove to be the biggest difference between remaining a regional tech hub and becoming a true global innovation center.

Telo raises $20 million to build tiny electric trucks for cities,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/telo-raises-20-million-to-build-tiny-electric-trucks-for-cities/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-23T09:55:45-07:00,"Big electric trucks are having a hard time. The Cybertruck is a bust , Stellantis just canceled the Ram 1500 REV , and even sales of Ford’s promising F-150 Lightning have been on the decline. But the United States loves trucks. So is the key to making them love electric trucks… a very small one? That’s the bet that California-based startup Telo has been making since its inception in 2022. The company has designed a bite-sized truck called the MT1 with an admittedly not-so-small starting price of around $41,000. Now, investors want in on that same bet: Telo announced Tuesday it has closed a $20 million Series A funding round. The round was co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar, and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo’s board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo. In the world of automotive manufacturing, $20 million does not go very far. To contrast, Slate Auto, which is building its own wild take on a small electric pickup truck, has raised more than $700 million . Startups like Fisker Inc. , Canoo , and Lordstown Motors also raised hundreds of millions before they all collapsed. Telo has far more modest goals and a sharper aim than those companies, though. “Our hyper-focus is on trucks for the downtowns of cities,” co-founder and CEO Jason Marks told TechCrunch on a video call while bouncing around Telo’s 10,000-square-foot San Carlos facility — which shares a backyard with the original Tesla headquarters. While Telo may someday embrace other markets — Marks said some small farmers are quite interested in the truck — the company considers those to be secondary. It’s cities that Marks wants to conquer first; the CEO said he’s spent far too much time circling San Francisco streets looking for parking to focus on any other use case. Telo is not promising to build hundreds of thousands of MT1s. Instead, it’s got a preorder list of around 12,000, and Marks said Telo initially plans to build around 5,000 per year via contract manufacturing. “Our whole ethos is, what does it take to get to unit profitability as quickly as possible,” he said. “That’s positioned us differently than the other automakers who have come out and said, ‘Hey, we need a billion dollars to get to production.’” The Series A funding will go toward building the final production-intent version of the MT1, homologating the vehicle to U.S. safety standards, and finishing crash testing. Marks said that last piece is key, because the MT1’s short front end has understandably inspired many questions about how safe the truck will be. Telo hopes to deliver its first MT1 by the end of 2026. To get the most out of the funding, Marks said Telo will stay “as lean as we physically can.” That means keeping its workforce to around 25 employees in the near-term, while leveraging consultants and contractors — many of whom Marks said have long-standing relationships with Tarpenning. The idea of using outside help is getting another boost with the Series A, as Marks said Telo filled the round with angel investors and smaller companies from across the EV world. “It’s a pretty incredible community that just wants to see new architectures for mobility succeed,” he said. The MT1 is a big idea, but it isn’t all about size. Marks said Telo has spent a lot of time making sure the MT1 is useful. For instance, he’s oriented the project around the idea of “performance per square foot.” “We’re the only vehicle that can seat five with a five-foot bed,” he said. That means despite the Telo truck’s diminutive stature, it squeezes in roughly an extra half-foot of space compared to some of the trucks it might compete with, like the 4.5-foot beds found on the all-electric Rivian R1T and the affordable compact Ford Maverick. But the biggest part of the MT1’s usefulness might be its range. Marks is adamant that the truck will get around 350 miles on a full battery, putting it up there with some of the most capable EVs on the market. Not only does that make the truck capable of longer drives, but it means less charging required for the city-dwellers Telo is targeting. Telo was able to hit this figure, according to Marks, through a combination of somewhat competing factors. The MT1’s small stature helps because it’s inherently not as heavy as a normal-sized truck, boosting efficiency. But that made it challenging to package the 106kWh battery pack in such a way that the MT1 wasn’t just a pallet of lithium-ion cells with seats. Marks didn’t go into too much detail, as Telo’s battery-related patents are still pending. But he said the MT1 essentially gives up some performance (like faster 0-60 speeds) in exchange for making the battery pack work in the footprint of a Mini Cooper. That robust range figure may be tempting if it ultimately bears out. And the rise in popularity of imported Japanese Kei trucks in the U.S. shows that people are willing to go to great lengths for something in this form factor. There are real headwinds against EVs in the U.S. these days, but Marks believes Telo can overcome them. “You’re told, ‘run fast, break things.’ It’s a very Silicon Valley nature,” he said. “But the other Silicon Valley nature is, how do you do a ton with the smallest amount of capital and the smallest team possible? Do things that big corporations can’t do?” Correction: This article previously mis-identified Marc Tarpenning as a Telo co-founder. He is on Telo’s board. The article has been updated.

Alloy is bringing data management to the robotics industry,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/alloy-is-bringing-data-management-to-the-robotics-industry/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-23T08:00:00-07:00,"Robotics companies often have to deal with a simple but confounding problem: Robots produce a lot of data. Even a simple robot can easily produce up to a terabyte of data per day, since they continuously capture data from cameras and sensors. Sydney, Australia-based Alloy thinks it can help with that issue: The startup is building data infrastructure for robotics companies to help them process and organize all the data their robots collect from various sources, including sensors and cameras. At its core, Alloy encodes and labels the data it collects, and allows users to search through their data using natural language to find bugs and errors. Users can also set up rules to catch and flag issues in the future, similar to how observability tools flag errors in software code. “The current pattern is, you look for some kind of anomaly, and then you’ll replay the data,” Joe Harris, the founder and CEO of Alloy, told TechCrunch. “They then are spending hours scrubbing through this data, looking for these issues that have been flagged to them, trying to diagnose from that [while] not really having a good view as to whether this has happened before, if it’s a high-severity issue or this one-off, edge case.” Considering how much data a single robot produces, as robotics companies look to scale, this data problem will continue to compound, Harris added. Harris has been fascinated by robotics since he was a kid. But when he graduated from college in 2018, there weren’t many opportunities to work in the field , so he instead worked multiple roles across Australian tech companies, including Atlassian and telehealth startup Eucalyptus. In 2024, he decided the time was right to launch a robotics company of his own. He originally thought he’d focus on building robots for the agriculture industry due to an interest in vertical farming, but when he started talking to other founders, the issue of managing the data robots produce kept coming up. He figured he might as well solve that problem first. “If I need to solve this problem for myself and my robotics company, I will have a great horizontal solution,” Harris said. “Perhaps that would be a more important near-term mission — to help enable other robotics companies to spend less time on data plumbing and more time on getting to that high reliability.” Since its launch in February 2025, Alloy has signed four Australian robotics companies as design partners and looks to push into the U.S. market this year. “The customers that we found have been most excited about this because they’ve gone through the pain of building and maintaining it themselves,” Harris said. “They’d much rather have a fantastic tool, like a Databricks just specifically built for robotics.” Alloy has also raised a little more than AUD $4.5 million (about $3 million) in a pre-seed round that was led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Airtree Ventures, Xtal Ventures, and Skip Capital, in addition to angel investors from robotics companies. The company doesn’t have too many direct competitors yet. Many robotics companies are either retrofitting existing data management tools that aren’t designed for the multimodal data robots produce, or are attempting to build their own internal data management tools. As commercial use cases for robotics continue to increase, Alloy hopes it will be able to capture a good share of the growing market. “It’s never been a better time to build a robotics company,” Harris said. “I really want to make it possible for the next 10,000, 100,000 robotics companies that don’t yet exist, that inevitably will not have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, like every company has.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Harris, Joe Harris","TechCrunch, Eucalyptus, Xtal Ventures, Blackbird Ventures, Skip Capital, Airtree Ventures","$4.5 m, $3 m",,AI

He also says that nearly all generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud, that 60% of all GenAI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider, and that the company has lined up $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, which represents more than double its current annual run rate. Asked what percentage of Google Cloud’s revenue comes from AI companies, he offers instead that “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups.” The Nvidia-OpenAI deal exemplifies the scale of consolidation sweeping AI infrastructure. Microsoft’s original $1 billion OpenAI investment has grown to nearly $14 billion. Amazon followed with $8 billion in Anthropic investments, securing deep hardware customizations that essentially tailor AI training to work better with Amazon’s infrastructure. Oracle has emerged as a surprise winner, too, landing a $30 billion cloud deal with OpenAI and then securing a jaw-dropping $300 billion five-year commitment starting in 2027. Even Meta, despite building its own infrastructure, signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud while planning $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure spending through 2028. The Trump administration’s $500 billion “Stargate” project, involving SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships. These gigantic deals might seem threatening for Google, given the partnerships that companies like OpenAI and Nvidia appear to be cementing elsewhere. In fact, it looks a lot like Google is being cut out of some frenzied dealmaking. But the corporate behemoth isn’t exactly sitting on its hands. Instead, Google Cloud is signing smaller companies like Lovable and Windsurf — what deSouza calls the “next generation of companies coming up,” without major up-front investments. The strategy extends beyond simple customer acquisition. Google offers AI startups $350,000 in cloud credits, access to its technical teams, and go-to-market support through its marketplace. Google Cloud also provides what deSouza describes as a “no compromise” AI stack — from chips to models to applications — with an “open ethos” that gives customers choice at every layer. The approach reflects both opportunity and necessity. In a market where companies can go “from being a startup to being a multibillion-dollar company in a very short period of time,” as deSouza puts it, capturing future unicorns before they mature could prove more valuable than fighting over today’s giants. “Companies love the fact that they can get access to our AI stack, they can get access to our teams to understand where our technologies are going,” deSouza says during our interview. “They also love that they’re getting access to enterprise-grade Google class infrastructure.” Google’s infrastructure play got even more ambitious recently, with reporting revealing the company’s behind-the-scenes maneuvering to expand its custom AI chip business. According to The Information , Google has struck deals to place its tensor processing units (TPUs) in other cloud providers’ data centers for the first time, including an agreement with London-based Fluidstack that includes up to $3.2 billion in financial backing for a New York facility. Competing directly with AI companies while simultaneously providing them infrastructure requires … finesse. Google Cloud provides TPU chips to OpenAI and hosts Anthropic’s Claude model through its Vertex AI platform, even as its own Gemini models compete head-to-head with both. (Google Cloud’s parent company, Alphabet, also owns a 14% stake in Anthropic, per New York Times court documents obtained earlier this year, though when asked directly about Google’s financial relationship with Anthropic, deSouza calls the relationship a “multi-layered partnership,” then quickly redirects me to Google Cloud’s model marketplace, noting that customers can access various foundation models.) But if Google is trying to be Switzerland while advancing its own agenda, it has had plenty of practice. The approach has roots in Google’s open source contributions, from Kubernetes to the foundational “ Attention Is All You Need ” paper that enabled the transformer architecture underlying most modern AI. More recently, Google published an open source protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A) for interagent communication in an attempt to demonstrate its continued commitment to openness even in competitive areas. “We have made the explicit choice over the years to be open at every layer of the stack, and we know that this means companies can absolutely take our technology and use it to build a competitor at the next layer,” deSouza acknowledges. “That’s been happening for decades. That’s something we are okay with.” Google Cloud’s courtship of startups comes at a particularly interesting moment. Just this month, federal judge Amit Mehta delivered a nuanced ruling in the government’s five-year-old search monopoly case, attempting to curb Google’s dominance without hampering its AI ambitions. While Google avoided the Justice Department’s most severe proposed penalties, including the forced divestment of its Chrome browser, the ruling underscored regulatory concerns about the company leveraging its search monopoly to dominate AI. Critics are worried, understandably, that Google’s vast trove of search data provides an unfair advantage in developing AI systems and that the company could deploy the same monopolistic tactics that secured its search dominance. In conversation, deSouza is focused on far more positive outcomes. “I think we have an opportunity to fundamentally understand some of the major diseases that today we just don’t have a good understanding of,” deSouza says, for example, outlining a vision where Google Cloud helps power research into Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and climate technologies. “We want to work very hard to make sure that we are pioneering the technologies that will enable that work.” Critics may not easily be assuaged. By positioning itself as an open platform that empowers rather than controls the next generation of AI companies, Google Cloud may be showing regulators that it fosters competition rather than stifles it, all while forging relationships with startups that might help Google’s case if regulators ramp up pressure. For our full chat with deSouza, check out this week’s StrictlyVC Download podcast; a new episode comes out every Tuesday. Also, note a correction made as of 9/26: We misquoted deSouza as calling Google Cloud the “primary” computing partner of startups Windsurf and Lovable; we apologize for the oversight.

"Neon, the No. 2 social app on the Apple App Store, pays users to record their phone calls and sells data to AI firms",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T12:50:58-07:00,"A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple’s U.S. App Store’s Social Networking section. The app, Neon Mobile , pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations. Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures . On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps. Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app. According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user. That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.” The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society. Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a: …worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed. That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims. The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs. Though Neon’s app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. “Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome ‘s Privacy, Security & Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch. “Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it … It’s an interesting approach,” says Daniels. Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed — and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users’ calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript. In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. Neon claims it removes users’ names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices. “Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.” Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be. In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user’s call, nor did it warn the call recipient. The app worked like any other voice-over-IP app, and the caller ID displayed the inbound phone number, as usual. (We’ll leave it to security researchers to attempt to verify the app’s other claims.) Neon founder Alex Kiam didn’t return a request for comment. Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows. A LinkedIn post indicates Kiam raised money from Upfront Ventures a few months ago for his startup, but the investor didn’t respond to an inquiry from TechCrunch as of the time of writing. There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them , it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps , which often aren’t as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that’s “commercially available” on the market. Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch. In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others’ privacy at risk when they do. “There is a tremendous desire on the part of, certainly, knowledge workers — and frankly, everybody — to make it as easy as possible to do your job,” says Jackson. “And some of these productivity tools do that at the expense of, obviously, your privacy, but also, increasingly, the privacy of those with whom you are interacting on a day-to-day basis.”  Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Kiam, Jackson, Daniels, mobile apps, Jennifer Daniels, Alex Kiam, Peter Jackson, Neon, App Store, Recordings","Security & Data Protection Group, TechCrunch, Apple, AI, Daniels, iPhone, Upfront Ventures, Greenberg Glusker, Neon, Blank Rome ‘s, Neon Mobile, LinkedIn, Social Networking",$30 ,,AI
"Trump hits H-1B visas with $100,000 fee, targeting the program that launched Elon Musk and Instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-mu***REMOVED***/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T12:13:20-07:00,"President Trump just made it a lot more expensive for companies to hire foreign workers through the H-1B program. The White House announced Friday that Trump signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a hefty $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, an enormous jump from the current $215 lottery registration fee. H-1B visas allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in fields that typically require technical expertise like IT, engineering, mathematics, or medicine. The program is capped at 65,000 new visas annually, plus an additional 20,000 for foreign graduates with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. The visas are awarded through a lottery system and typically last three years, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. The administration’s new move is designed to crack down on what it calls widespread abuse of the program, which it blames for displacing American workers. According to the White House, the share of IT workers with H-1B visas has skyrocketed from 32% in 2003 to over 65% today, while unemployment among recent computer science graduates has hit 6.1%. Silicon Valley will undoubtedly be up in arms over the initiative. The restrictions take aim at a program that helped create some of the region’s biggest success stories. Elon Musk, Trump’s close ally for most of this year, initially worked in the U.S. on an H-1B after arriving as a student. In fact, Musk, taking issue with a perceived critic of the H-1B program in December on his platform X, tweeted to the individual that, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B. Take a big step back and F*** YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder-turned-chief-product-officer at AI giant Anthropic, is one of those aforementioned success stories. The Brazilian-born Stanford grad worked at the early instant messaging platform Meebo on an H-1B visa. Earlier this year, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) argued in a letter to the National Science Foundation: “Raising the annual cap of H-1B visas issued each year to educated and highly skilled immigrants who work in jobs that require a substantial amount of technical and specialized training is fundamental to generating more successful immigrant-founded companies.” The NVCA noted that while “H-1B visas are not ideal for immigrants who want to immediately found companies in the U.S., they are still critically important for the success of immigrant founded companies because they provide valuable work experience and widen the pipeline of potential immigrant startup founders.” (The H-1B’s employer-employee requirement makes it practically impossible for founders to obtain directly, forcing them to spend years tied to employers before getting green cards that let them launch their own startups. When Krieger wanted to co-found Instagram in 2010, transferring his visa took months, and he has said he almost abandoned the startup before it launched due to those complications.) On Friday, tech leaders on X were already warning about talent fleeing to more welcoming countries. And Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have reportedly told employees with H-1B visas to avoid foreign travel and remain in the United states for now . In the meantime, in its proclamation on Friday, the Trump administration went full bore on its criticism of the program, pointing to specific companies that approved thousands of H-1B workers while simultaneously laying off American employees. According to the White House fact sheet, one unnamed company received approval for 5,189 H-1B workers this fiscal year while cutting roughly 16,000 U.S. jobs. The proclamation —  which says it is partly rooted in an effort to “protect our national security” —  includes wiggle room; case-by-case exemptions are possible if deemed in the national interest. It also directs the labor secretary to revise wage requirements to prevent undercutting American salaries. This post has been updated to include reports on how Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are responding.

"Updates to Studio, YouTube Live, new GenAI tools, and everything else announced at Made on YouTube",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/updates-to-studio-youtube-live-new-gen-ai-tools-and-everything-else-announced-at-made-on-youtube/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T08:00:00-07:00,"At its annual Made on YouTube event this week, YouTube unveiled tons of new updates, features, and tools geared toward creators, including updates to YouTube Live, new ways to monetize, and more. Studio updates include “likeness” detection and lip-synced dubs, and the company is offering new AI tools for podcasters to help promote their shows. Here’s everything announced at Made on YouTube. The company showed off new and updated tools to Studio , which creators use to manage their channels and track analytics. Updates include an inspiration tab, title A/B testing features, auto dubbing, and more. What caught our attention is the “likeness”-detection feature, which was announced last year and made available to a few creators; it’s now in open beta. People will be able to detect, manage, and flag for removal any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness. An AI-powered Ask Studio can guide users and answer questions about their account, and creators will be able to collaborate with up to five other people on one video, which is available to the audiences of all the participating video makers. YouTube gave Live, its livestreaming platform , some updates as well, like letting creators play minigames to entertain viewers, broadcasting simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical formats, providing AI-powered highlights, reacting to live events, using a new ad format, and more. The AI-powered highlights automatically select the best moments from a livestream to turn them into shareable Shorts, and a new ad format — called “side-by-side” — runs adjacent to the main content, similar to a split-screen display, rather than interrupting the stream. YouTube is bringing a custom version of Veo 3 , Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, to Shorts, as well as a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and more. With Veo 3 Fast, as the custom version is called, creators can apply motion from a video to an image, add different styles to their videos, and insert objects into the video with a simple text prompt. Creators can also transform the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for other Shorts using Google’s AI music model, Lyria 2. YouTube Music got some updates as well , designed to deepen engagement between creators and their fans. These include a countdown timer for new releases and a chance to offer fans “thank you” videos, and the company is testing a pilot program for U.S. listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists. Video podcast creators in the U.S. will be able to create clips more easily with AI suggestions , according to YouTube. And a new feature rolling out next year will offer a way to turn audio podcasts into video podcasts YouTube is giving creators new ways to monetize , with brand deals and through the YouTube Shopping program, which lets creators earn money by featuring and tagging products in their content. YouTube will also now allow creators to swap out brand sponsorships in long-form videos. In addition, creators can take advantage of auto timestamps for product tags, auto tagging for eligible items mentioned in videos, and a new brand link feature for Shorts. An AI-powered system will help identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time. Shorts creators will soon be able to add a link to a brand’s site specifically for brand deals, and YouTube will proactively suggest creators who may be a good fit for brands in its creator partnerships hub.

"Google isn’t kidding around about cost cutting, even slashing its FT subscription",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/google-isnt-kidding-around-about-cost-cutting-even-slashing-its-ft-subscription/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T22:25:49-07:00,"Google is ending its enterprise subscription to the Financial Times, and it’s not the only enterprise media subscription on the chopping block, sources say. The cuts reflect broader cost-reduction efforts at the search giant, even as the company reports strong financial performance. Google has been implementing cost reductions across 2025, including eliminating 35% of managers who oversee teams of three people or fewer, and offering voluntary exit programs across multiple divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi signaled late last year that the company would continue to push cost cuts “a little further,” a mandate that appears unchanged despite Alphabet reporting strong Q2 2025 results with $96.4 billion in revenue. These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers. August data from the trade association Digital Content Next showed median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers fell 10% between May and June of this year, with non-news brands experiencing 14% drops. Major outlets, including CNN, Business Insider, and HuffPost have reportedly seen even sharper traffic declines (of 30%, 40%, and 40% , respectively), according to data from SimilarWeb. Publishers attribute these declines largely to Google’s AI Overviews feature, which has reduced click-throughs to external websites from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to Pew Research. This spring, Pew analyzed data from 900 U.S. adults, six in 10 of whom conducted at least one Google search in March 2025 that produced an AI-generated summary. A Google spokesperson responded to this story after publication, stating: “The claim that this is due to a change in our commitment to news partnerships is patently false. Our partnerships regularly evolve, and we have partnerships in place with more than 2800 publications worldwide and we’ve made billions of dollars in payments directly to publishers, platforms and content providers.” The traffic decline comes as Google has largely resisted content licensing, unlike rival OpenAI, which has signed deals with numerous major publishers, including The Financial Times , News Corp , and Axel Springer. So far at least, Google has struck few deals, including one with the Associated Press and an annual Reddit agreement reportedly worth $60 million per year. (According to a new Bloomberg report , Reddit is now looking to renegotiate its contracts with both Google and OpenAI, with Bloomberg suggesting that Reddit sees its prominent role in search results and generative AI training as even more valuable than it first understood.) Google reportedly began exploratory talks with 20 outlets about more content licensing deals this summer. Still, some might see Google canceling its FT subscription as akin to a plagiarist refusing to buy the textbook they’re copying from. At a Fortune event earlier this month, the CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. — Neil Vogel of People Inc. — didn’t hold his punches, calling Google a “ bad actor ” and accusing it of using the same bot to crawl websites for its search engine as it does to support its AI features. While Google’s approach to AI training has differed from other AI players, the company does offer publishers ways to opt out of having their data used without affecting search access. “For a long time,” Vogel said at the event, “the deal was: ‘Take our content, build your search engine, send us back traffic’. That deal’s off.” In a separate, scathing op-ed this summer, Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint wrote that Google’s AI overviews are creating a “zero-click” environment where “ all traffic dead ends at Google .” Editor’s note: This story has been updated post-publication to include a statement from Google and to correct an inaccurate characterization of Google’s AI training policies. The original story incorrectly stated that publishers cannot block Google’s AI systems without also forfeiting search traffic. Google offers an opt-out option that allows publishers to block AI training while maintaining search access.

Meta CTO explains why the smart glasses demos failed at Meta Connect — and it wasn’t the Wi-Fi,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-cto-explains-why-the-smart-glasses-demos-failed-at-meta-connect-and-it-wasnt-the-wi-fi/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T09:04:11-07:00,"Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth took to his Instagram to explain, in more technical detail, why multiple demos of Meta’s new smart glasses technology failed at Meta Connect, the company’s developer conference, this week. Meta on Wednesday introduced three new pairs of smart glasses, including an upgraded version of its existing Ray-Ban Meta, a new Meta Ray-Ban Display that comes with a wristband controller, and the sports-focused Oakley Meta Vanguard . However, at different points during the event, the live technology demos failed to work. In one, cooking content creator Jack Mancuso asked his Ray-Ban Meta glasses how to get started with a particular sauce recipe. After repeating the question, “What do I do first?” with no response, the AI skipped ahead in the recipe, forcing him to stop the demo. He then tossed it back to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that he thinks the Wi-Fi may be messed up. In another demo, the glasses failed to pick up a live WhatsApp video call between Bosworth and Zuckerberg; Zuckerberg eventually had to give up. Bosworth walked onstage, joking about the “brutal” Wi-Fi. “You practice these things like a hundred times, and then you never know what’s gonna happen,” Zuckerberg said at the time. After the event, Bosworth took to his Instagram for a Q&A session about the new tech and the live demo failures. On the latter, he explained that it wasn’t actually the Wi-Fi that caused the issue with the chef’s glasses. Instead, it was a mistake in resource management planning. “When the chef said, ‘Hey, Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Ray-Ban Meta’s Live AI in the building. And there were a lot of people in that building,” Bosworth explained. “That obviously didn’t happen in rehearsal; we didn’t have as many things,” he said, referring to the number of glasses that were triggered. That alone wasn’t enough to cause the disruption, though. The second part of the failure had to do with how Meta had chosen to route the Live AI traffic to its development server to isolate it during the demo. But when it did so, it did this for everyone in the building on the access points, which included all the headsets. “So we DDoS’d ourselves, basically, with that demo,” Bosworth added. (A DDoS attack, or a distributed denial of service attack, is one where a flood of traffic overwhelms a server or service, slowing it down or making it unavailable. In this case, Meta’s dev server wasn’t set up to handle the flood of traffic from the other glasses in the building — Meta was only planning for it to handle the demos alone.) The issue with the failed WhatsApp call, on the other hand, was the result of a new bug. The smart glasses’ display had gone to sleep at the exact moment the call came in, Bosworth said. When Zuckerberg woke the display back up, it didn’t show the answer notification to him. The CTO said this was a “race condition” bug, or where the outcome depends on the unpredictable and uncoordinated timing of two or more different processes trying to use the same resource simultaneously. “We’ve never run into that bug before,” Bosworth noted. “That’s the first time we’d ever seen it. It’s fixed now, and that’s a terrible, terrible place for that bug to show up.” He stressed that, of course, Meta knows how to handle video calls, and the company was “bummed” about the bug showing up here. Despite the issues, Bosworth said he’s not worried about the results of the glitches. “Obviously, I don’t love it, but I know the product works. I know it has the goods. So it really was just a demo fail and not, like, a product failure,” he said.

How AI startups are fueling Google’s booming cloud business,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-18T13:53:33-07:00,"Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers. Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as one of their cloud computing providers, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud tells TechCrunch that it handles a significant percentage of Lovable and Windsurf’s cloud and AI workloads today, though the startups are not contractually obligated to primarily work with Google. The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future. Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum. Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023. Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI , and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud. While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition , spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment. Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin. In an interview with TechCrunch, Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said the startup works with a variety of cloud providers, including Google Cloud, but it’s hard to say which company it uses the most. Lovable declined to comment. The significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it’s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research. The company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder’s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named. Part of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program. Update 9/19/25: This article has been updated to clarify language around the term “primary cloud computing provider” and include comment from Windsurf’s CEO. Neither Lovable nor Windsurf have signed a preferred cloud provider agreement, a contractual designation that guarantees a startup does a majority of their work with a single cloud provider.

AI company Superpanel raises $5.3M seed to automate legal intake,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/superpanel-raises-5-3m-seed-to-automate-legal-intake/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-23T07:50:00-07:00,"For Julien Emery, the problem has always been personal. He’s the CEO and co-founder of Superpanel , a platform that helps law firms seamlessly onboard new clients. He listed emotional encounters with the law: As a Canadian, he found access to legal help hard and expensive; he also recalls his mother in a car accident, and how the legal payout helped keep his family afloat for years. He found the legal intake — the process of a firm evaluating a new client or request — tedious. “For consumers, it’s a maze of forms, phone calls, and dropped leads that cause most people to give up before getting help,” he told TechCrunch. “For firms, it’s a costly, error-prone bottleneck.” Before the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, he said that the intake process was regarded as too complex for automation. But that’s changed. Emery worked at Hootsuite, then founded the health insurance underwriting platform Allay (which exited to Novo Benefits), before teaming up with his friend Dingyu Zhang, who had a background in AI, to launch Superpanel in 2024. Superpanel automates half the work of legal intake, Emery said, managing collection and feedback. It provides plaintiff law firms with a “digital teammate” that helps with escalation and compliance. “It engages clients across phone, texting, email, and forums, guiding them through their story and sharing documents,” he continued. For firms, it helps sort case type, jurisdiction, and documentation. “When there’s risk of ambiguity, the system escalates to a human team member,” he said. “The result is a unified, multi-channel workflow that delivers measurable results and gives firms a system they can trust like a real employee.” The company announced Tuesday a seed $5.3 million raise in a round co-led by Outlander VC and Field Ventures. Emery said he met some investors in this round through his last startup, and those early investors introduced him to the ones who led the round for this new one. Others in this round include LOI Venture (co-founded by the founder of Hootsuite), Zenda Capital, 8-Bit Capital, and Behind Genius Ventures. “We’ll use the funding to accelerate hiring and expand Superpanel’s capabilities for plaintiff law firms,” he said. Legal is one of the top industries seeing transformation as artificial intelligence continues to innovate. So Superpanel certainly isn’t alone in this space, and its competitors include Clio Grow, LegalClerk.ai, MyCase, and Whippy.ai. But Emery is hoping Superpanel will stand out from the pack. “Consumers now expect answers and solutions to be instant and self-serve, shaped by AI tools and the online experiences they use every day,” Emery said. “Superpanel guides them continuously across that journey.”  Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Outlander VC, Novo Benefits, Behind Genius Ventures, Dingyu Zhang, Clio Grow, Julien Emery, Hootsuite, Zenda Capital","Superpanel, TechCrunch, LOI Venture, Field Ventures, Emery, Whippy.ai",$5.3 m,hiring,AI

Sila opens US factory to make silicon anodes for energy-dense EV batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/23/sila-opens-u-s-factory-to-make-silicon-anodes-for-energy-dense-ev-batteries/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-23T02:45:00-07:00,"Sila, the battery materials startup, started operations Tuesday at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer-range, faster-charging EVs. The factory, which will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs, is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West, and future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles. Silicon anodes promise to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries by as much as 50%. The technology, which Sila has been working on for the past 14 years, could be the best chance for the U.S. to gain the upper hand in a global race for battery supremacy, Sila co-founder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky argues. “When you invent something new, it’s a lot easier to then produce it where you invent it,” he told TechCrunch. Sila currently has agreements to supply anode material to Panasonic and Mercedes . Though automakers and their suppliers will be the factory’s main focus, Berdichevsky said his company has also been selling to drone manufacturers, satellite companies, and consumer electronics companies. The startup isn’t the only company working on silicon anode materials. Group14 , which also has operations in Moses Lake, currently produces its proprietary mix at a factory it developed with SK Innovation in South Korea. Amprius, a company based in Fremont, California, is currently producing megawatt-hours’ worth of its material in the U.S. and gigawatt-hours’ worth with partners in China. But Sila’s Moses Lake factory, which has been under construction for nearly two years, “is really the first auto scale silicon anode plant in the U.S.,” Berdichevsky said. The company raised $375 million last year to help finance the project. In Washington State, Sila found a near perfect confluence of factors that allowed it to build the facility, including cheap hydropower, abundant land, and a nearby supplier of an important raw ingredient. “The cost structure of this technology is predicated on low-cost energy — one of the big inputs — and then some key precursors, and we have that in Washington,” he said. The first runs of material at the Moses Lake factory will be used to show customers the material is consistent with the stuff they’ve been sampling for the past few years, which was made at an R&D line in Alameda, California. “We have a lot of confidence in that, but obviously the proof’s in the pudding,” Berdichevsky said. In a few years, he said batteries made using Sila’s material should be cheaper than those made with graphite anode material sourced from Western suppliers. (Chinese companies make graphite anodes for less, but they also receive generous state subsidies and have fewer environmental regulations, Berdichevsky said.) Silicon anodes could also allow automakers to reduce the amount of other pricey materials used in their batteries, including nickel, while maintaining the same level of performance. “Now you have that same performance, plus you get fast charge, plus you get domestic supply, and you get it at a lower cost,” he said. If demand proves strong, Sila has plans to expand beyond Moses Lake. “There’s not a CEO of a Western automaker that doesn’t believe that within a decade, or maybe 15 years at the limit, they’re going to be selling almost all electric vehicles.” Berdichevsky said.“ If you play it out 10 years from now, you probably have 10 million EVs in the U.S., so we’re going to need multiple sites.” Eventually, the company will look to expand into Europe and Asia, too, but Berdichevsky, who was born in Ukraine, is adamant in his commitment to the United States. “As a country, if you don’t make stuff, where’s your pride going to come from?” he said. “I think it’s just so important for us as a country to continue to learn to do this and create the ecosystem so that we can never fall behind again.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Sila, Gene Berdichevsky, Amprius, Berdichevsky","TechCrunch, Mercedes, Sila’s Moses Lake, Panasonic",$375 m,,AI
"Rocket.new, one of India’s first vibe-coding startups, snags $15M from Accel, Salesforce Ventures",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/rocket-new-one-of-indias-first-vibe-coding-startups-snags-15m-from-accel-salesforce-ventures/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-22T22:30:00-07:00,"Rocket.new , an Indian startup building an AI-powered app development platform, has raised $15 million in a seed round led by Salesforce Ventures to take on viral vibe-coding rivals like Lovable, Cursor, and Bolt by letting users build full, production-ready apps from natural-language prompts rather than just quick prototypes. Accel and Together Fund joined Salesforce Ventures in the all-equity seed round, which comes only three months after Rocket.new launched its platform in beta in June. Since its debut, the startup has crossed 400,000 users — including over 10,000 paid subscribers — in 180 countries and reached $4.5 million in annual recurring revenue. It is aiming to scale that to $20-$25 million by year’s end and $60-$70 million by June next year, co-founder and CEO Vishal Virani (pictured above, center) said in an exclusive interview. Based in Surat — a city famous for diamonds and textiles but far from India’s usual tech hubs — Virani teamed up with Rahul Shingala and Deepak Dhanak to launch Rocket.new. The startup marks a pivot from their earlier venture, DhiWise, which focused on developer workflows. “We are building the first vibe solution platform, which is not solving just a problem of day one, but what we are focusing on is solving the problem of day two,” Virani told TechCrunch. The 16-week-old startup aims to become a comprehensive agentic system, which will utilize AI not only to build apps and websites but also to conduct competitive research and product development, eliminating the need for product managers. “Our entire agentic system will help organizations build all kinds of functions around products — not just generating the source code — but even a facility to scale their product — all by giving natural-language prompts,” Virani asserted. The current model, which Virani refers to as version 0.3, has already built half a million applications and attracted product managers, solopreneurs, and front-end developers. It also counts users from companies like Meta, PayPal, KPMG, PwC, and Times Internet, who turn to the platform for personal projects. About 80% of Rocket.new’s users have so far built what Virani calls “serious” applications rather than simple landing pages or branding sites. Roughly 12% have created e-commerce platforms in segments like grocery and apparel, 10% have built fintech apps, 5-6% have developed B2B tools, and 4-5% have launched mental health apps, he said. Roughly 45% of Rocket.new’s users are building mobile apps and 55% are building websites, Virani said. He added that many users build a website on Lovable or Replit, then turn to Rocket.new to generate a native mobile app by integrating with their existing Supabase backend. The platform combines large language models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini with Rocket.new’s own deep learning systems, which are trained on proprietary datasets from DhiWise. “Our underlying architecture is completely different from what Lovable, Bolt, and everyone is doing,” Virani told TechCrunch. Generating the first application takes about 25 minutes — much slower than most vibe-coding tools, which usually produce results within three. But in our early testing, Rocket.new delivered a more comprehensive user experience, with all essential modules included. Rocket.new offers a free trial capped at one million tokens. After that, users pay a monthly subscription starting at $25 for five million tokens. This model effectively discourages hobbyists, while giving Rocket.new a healthy gross margin of 50-55% — a figure it aims to raise to 60-70% within the next few months. The U.S. is Rocket.new’s largest market, contributing 26% of revenue, followed by Europe at 15-20% and India at 10%. To better serve its American users, the startup is establishing a U.S. headquarters in Palo Alto. Virani noted that Rocket.new’s early traction was organic, driven by word-of-mouth and viral social posts. With fresh seed funding, the startup is looking to sharpen its go-to-market playbook, deepen its presence in key markets, and accelerate work on proprietary models and R&D. “We saw a clear gap between the magic of AI code generation and the reality of making that code production-ready,” Kartik Gupta, investor at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch over email. “Rocket.new is purpose-built to solve this problem of iteration, maintenance, and deployment at enterprise scale.” Rocket.new currently has a 58-member team, primarily in Surat, and expects to double its engineering and product staff in India over the next 12 months to support growth.

Mirror founder Brynn Putnam to unveil her gaming hardware startup at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/mirror-founder-brynn-putnam-to-unveil-her-gaming-hardware-startup-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-22T15:38:23-07:00,"Seven years after unveiling Mirror at TechCrunch Disrupt 2018, Brynn Putnam is returning to the stage where it all began. The serial entrepreneur who turned a fitness concept into a $500 million acquisition by Lululemon will debut her latest venture at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 at San Francisco’s Moscone West in October. Putnam’s path from that breakthrough Disrupt moment to today is a story of very smart timing. Mirror, the connected fitness device that brought boutique workout classes into homes, launched just as the pandemic created unprecedented demand for home fitness solutions. The timing proved so prescient that Lululemon acquired the company for $500 million just two years after its Disrupt debut. Now Putnam is betting on another cultural shift — the growing desire to disconnect from screens and reconnect with family and friends in person. Her new company, still operating in stealth mode, is developing consumer gaming hardware designed to bring people face-to-face rather than isolate them behind individual devices. “We’re about to enter a golden age of hardware,” Putnam recently told TechCrunch at one of its investor-focused StrictlyVC evenings , pointing to the convergence of mature display technologies, affordable components, and AI capabilities that make new types of interactive devices possible. The new venture represents a shift in priorities for Putnam. Where Mirror was about individual performance and self-improvement, her latest project focuses on shared experiences and strengthening relationships. She describes it as using technology not as the primary experience but as an enabler for better human connections. Drawing inspiration from Nintendo’s philosophy of using “withered technology with lateral thinking” — mature, affordable components combined with innovative experiences — Putnam is following the playbook that made Mirror successful. Rather than pushing technological boundaries, though, she’s focusing on creating compelling user experiences with proven hardware. The gaming space represents a natural next step for Putnam, who built her reputation on understanding how tech can motivate behavior change. Her boutique fitness studios taught her how to create engaging group experiences, lessons she applied to Mirror’s virtual classes and now to gaming scenarios that encourage face-to-face interaction. Lerer Hippeau, the venture firm that led Mirror’s $3 million seed round, has already participated in a highly competitive funding round for Putnam’s new company, signaling strong investor confidence in her ability to identify and capitalize on consumer trends. The timing also aligns with a broader resurgence in consumer hardware investing. After years of focus on enterprise software and AI infrastructure, investors are showing renewed interest in consumer-facing hardware that can leverage AI and mature component ecosystems to create new categories of devices. Putnam’s appearance at Disrupt 2025 comes as TechCrunch celebrates its 20th anniversary, and attendees can be assured we’re bringing together the biggest names in tech to share insights on the future of innovation. Meanwhile, for entrepreneurs and investors watching consumer tech trends, Putnam’s return to the Disrupt Stage will provide a chance to see how one of the category’s most successful recent founders is positioning for the next wave of innovation.

Charles Hudson and Wesley Chan will share the traits they consistently look for in zero-to-one founders, the red flags that raise eyebrows, and the most common mistakes first-time entrepreneurs make when fundraising. Pre-seed and seed fundraising often happens before there’s a product, user base, or traction. That means investors are betting on the founder, not the business. And few know how to make that call better than Hudson and Chan. Between them, they’ve backed hundreds of founders at the earliest stages, before the pitch decks were polished, before there were metrics to show, and often before a single line of code had shipped. Charles Hudson , managing partner of Precursor Ventures, has invested in more than 400 companies and supported over 450 founders. He’s built his reputation on backing people with bold ideas and unique perspectives, saying recently: “The earlier you invest, the more important it is to believe in the founder’s narrative and ability to adapt. It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about whether I believe you’re the one to do it.” Wesley Chan , co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, is known for placing bold early bets on category-defining companies. A Google veteran, he helped create Google Analytics and Google Voice before moving into venture, where he’s backed unicorns like Canva, Robinhood, and Plaid. His investing philosophy centers on identifying mission-driven founders who can turn scrappy beginnings into lasting impact.

A comprehensive list of 2025 tech layoffs,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/tech-layoffs-2025-list/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-22T09:28:23-07:00,"The tech layoff wave is still kicking in 2025. Last year saw more than 150,000 job cuts across 549 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi . So far this year, more than 22,000 workers have been the victim of reductions across the tech industry, with a staggering 16,084 cuts taking place in February alone. We’re tracking layoffs in the tech industry in 2025 so you can see the trajectory of the cutbacks and understand the impact on innovation across all types of companies. As businesses continue to embrace AI and automation, this tracker serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs — and what could be at stake with increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known tech layoffs that have occurred in 2025, which will be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here . If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here .  Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, cutting roughly 500 jobs , according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 262 in San Francisco , just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters , according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles, and follows a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue earlier this month. Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy. Laid off about 100 employees last month , around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets.

Bluesky says it’s getting more aggressive about moderation and enforcement,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/bluesky-says-its-getting-more-aggressive-about-moderation-and-enforcement/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-22T06:40:12-07:00,"It sounds like Bluesky is getting serious about giving some users the boot, with the company saying it will be doing more to “enforce our moderation policies to better cultivate a space for healthy conversations.” This is part of a broader update to the social media company’s community guidelines, after Bluesky asked users in August to provide feedback on an earlier draft of these changes. In a new blog post , the company said it received comments from more than 14,000 community members and that it “especially heard from community members who shared concerns about how the guidelines could impact creative expression and traditionally marginalized voices.” “After considering this feedback, and in a return to our experimental roots, we are going to bring a greater focus to encouraging constructive dialogue and enforcing our rules against harassment and toxic content,” the company said. “For starters, we are going to increase our enforcement efforts.” As part of that enforcement, Bluesky said that it will “more quickly escalate enforcement actions towards account restrictions.” When asked for more details, a Bluesky spokesperson told TechCrunch that moving forward, users who violate the guidelines will be getting fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated. In addition, the company will be “making product changes that clarify when content is likely to violate our community guidelines” — so perhaps users will also see more warnings before they post content that might run afoul of the guidelines. Who gets banned and why remains a fraught issue for Bluesky (as it is for most social networks). For example, there have been recurring complaints that accounts fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza have been unfairly suspended . More recently, many users criticized Bluesky’s decision to temporarily suspend the horror writer Gretchen Felker-Martin due to her now-deleted comments about the shooting of Charlie Kirk . Writer Roxane Gay described Bluesky’s decision — along with DC Comics’ cancellation of Felker-Martin’s “Red Hood” comic book — as “unacceptable,” “ridiculous,” and an “absolute shame.” Felker-Martin responded succinctly to Bluesky’s post announcing the new guidelines, writing, “thanks this sucks.” In addition to criticism from its more left-leaning users, Bluesky also faces ongoing complaints that it has become a liberal echo chamber. (And there definitely seem to be users who can’t take a joke .) The company’s post mentions other upcoming product changes, including a “zen mode” that would set new defaults for users who want a calmer social media experience, as well as “prompts for how to engage in more constructive conversations.” Bluesky said the actual guidelines have been further revised based on user feedback, with more specific language in some sections, as well as a new section about protected expression, such as journalism and education. Since these changes were announced on Friday, much of the response on Bluesky has focused on guidelines that forbid “sexual content involving non-consensual activity,” even if the content is animated, illustrated, or synthetic. (Gaming marketplaces, including Steam and Itch.io , recently faced backlash after seeming to crack down on games with edgy or even illegal adult content.) One user, for example, complained that Bluesky should “worry less about whether or not a cartoon has rights and more about whether real life trans and Palestinian people do.” Another said this language “has literally always been there because it’s boilerplate social media stuff” and suggested that users were confused because of “bluesky’s dogs–t comms.” The Bluesky spokesperson said, “There’s been some misunderstanding here — we haven’t changed anything about our enforcement in this area and have no intention of doing so.” The new guidelines are scheduled to take effect on October 15.

"Powered by India’s small businesses, UK fintech Tide becomes a TPG-backed unicorn",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/powered-by-indias-small-businesses-uk-fintech-tide-becomes-a-tpg-backed-unicorn/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-21T23:00:00-07:00,"U.K.-based fintech Tide has entered the unicorn club with a fresh funding of $120 million led by TPG, as the startup now serves over 1.6 million micro and small enterprises globally — with more than half of them based in India, the company’s largest and fastest-growing market. The new round — a mix of primary and secondary investment, though the startup declined to confirm the exact split — values the eight-year-old startup at $1.5 billion. It includes share sales by employees, early angels, and a few minority investors. TPG backed the round through its multi-sector impact vehicle, The Rise Fund, which has invested in over 85 mission-driven companies. Existing investor, the Apax Digital Funds, also participated. Globally, micro and small enterprises, including contractors, freelancers, and solopreneurs, spend a significant amount of time on business management tasks like accounting, invoicing, taxes, securing loans, and managing payments and expenses. While traditional banks and fintech startups offer services to this segment, most solutions are not purpose-built for their unique needs. Tide aims to change that with its unified business platform, offering tailored tools such as accounting integrations, invoicing, business loans, asset finance, payroll, expense cards, and even company registration. Initially launched in the U.K. in 2017, Tide expanded into India in December 2022 to tap into the country’s vast base of small enterprises — around 60 million micro and small businesses employing over 250 million people, per the recent Indian government data. Since its entry, Tide has onboarded more than 800,000 Indian businesses, which it refers to as “members” — surpassing its U.K. member base of nearly 800,000. In the U.K., where Tide is already profitable, the company serves around 14% of the country’s small and medium business market. “There is a huge trend to formalization. So, our biggest enemy is cash, and not any competitors,” said Oliver Prill, CEO of Tide, in an interview. “In India, there’s a debate, as the growth rate slowed a little bit, but it’s still a hugely impressive growth rate. You look at continental Europe or the U.K., the growth rate is a lot less,” he told TechCrunch. Tide estimates that around 4 million micro and small businesses are launched in India every year. These businesses typically seek support in areas like accessing formal credit, accepting Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for payments, and navigating the country’s indirect tax system, the Goods and Services Tax. Tide serves them through its digital platform, available as an app on both iOS and Android. The U.K. startup expects to onboard 1 million businesses in India by the end of this year and is already seeing strong demand from tier-3 cities and beyond (referring to smaller, less urbanized towns with limited digital and financial infrastructure), Gurjodhpal Singh, CEO of Tide India, told TechCrunch. In India, Tide works with around 25 lenders on its platform to facilitate credit for small businesses, recommending partners based on each business’s needs. The company also offers services such as fixed deposits, bill payments, bank transfers, and cash withdrawals through ATMs. In addition to the U.K. and India, Tide launched in Germany in May 2024 and expanded into France earlier this month. The startup offers a tailored experience in each market, including local language support. With the fresh funding, Tide plans to expand further geographically, enhance its product, and invest in agentic AI. The startup covers a range of finance and admin services already, but there are still some gaps to fill. “In the next few months and quarters, you’ll see some major developments in that area,” Prill said, referring to upcoming product launches enabled by the latest funding round. Tide currently employs over 2,500 people across its global operations.

Nvidia eyes $500M investment into self-driving tech startup Wayve,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/nvidia-eyes-500m-investment-into-self-driving-tech-startup-wayve/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T13:55:54-07:00,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang descended on the United Kingdom this week, armed with a pledge to invest £2 billion ($2.6 billion) to supercharge the country’s AI startup ecosystem. Wayve, the U.K.-based self-driving tech startup, could be one of those to receive funds from Nvidia’s AI investment commitment, the company told TechCrunch. Wayve said it has signed a letter of intent with Nvidia to evaluate a $500 million strategic investment in the U.K. startup’s next funding round. Nvidia participated in Wayve’s $1.05 billion Series C round that closed in May 2024. A Wayve spokesperson confirmed that the $500 million tentative commitment is part of Nvidia’s AI startup investment pledge. Nvidia said during an event Thursday the £2 billion commitment would include funds from venture-capital investors Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures, and Phoenix Court. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the letter of intent announcement. Wayve co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall wouldn’t provide TechCrunch with a projected closing date for its Series D round. Kendall did say the company was “working quickly towards it.” Wayve, which launched in 2017, has gained attention and investors for its automated driving system that uses a self-learning versus rules-based approach to its self-driving software. Wayve’s end-to-end neural network doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. That data-driven learning approach is used for “eyes on” assisted driving and an “eyes off” fully automated driving system. The company plans to sell its “Embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies. Wayve’s self-learning approach, which is similar to the strategy that Tesla uses, is seen as particularly appealing to automakers because it’s not reliant on specific sensors or maps. This means Wayve’s system can work with existing sensors like cameras and radar. The automated driving software captures data from those sensors, which directly informs the driving decisions of the system. And while Wayve’s software can run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles, the startup has had a close development relationship with Nvidia since 2018. Wayve’s generation 2 self-driving platform, which is integrated into its Ford Mach E test vehicles, uses Nvidia GPUs. This week, the startup unveiled gen 3, a platform that uses the in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The gen 3 will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 driverless features that will work on city streets and highways. Nvidia, and in particular Huang, seems keen to be part of Wayve’s future. “The next trillion-dollar company, you guys,” Huang said in a video featuring his first ride in a Wayve-equipped vehicle on public streets in London. The video, which was viewed by TechCrunch and is slated to be released soon, shows Huang handing Kendall Nvidia’s Thor developer kit. “We picked him up from his hotel and went for a drive around Central London through some really busy streets, including Hyde Park corner — that’s this massive roundabout here,” Kendall said in an interview Friday. “I really loved that experience, and it was cool to show him what we’ve always been building on as a result of Nvidia’s platform over the years.”   Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Wayve’s, Huang, Kendall Nvidia’s, Jensen Huang, Alex Kendall, Wayve","TechCrunch, Phoenix Court, Ford Mach, Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, Hoxton Ventures, OEM, Kendall, Tesla, Accel, Air Street Capital, Nvidia, Wayve, Balderton","$2.6 b, $500 m, $1.05 b, $500 m",,AI

The four-year-old startup targets low- to middle-income users — a segment often underserved by traditional financial institutions — by allowing them to save in gold for as little as ₹10 (about $0.11) a day. That strategy has helped Jar reach over 35 million registered users across 12,000 zip codes, co-founder and CEO Nishchay AG said in an interview. About 60% of users are from India’s smaller cities and towns (known as tier-2 and tier-3 towns), and more than 95% are saving formally for the first time, he told TechCrunch. The startup’s financials reflect this momentum, and two sources familiar with the matter tell TechCrunch that it is even planning to go public next year. Investment bankers are engaging with the startup for its IPO, the sources said. These bankers have a compelling growth story to share. Jar’s operating revenue — primarily from its core gold-saving app — grew ninefold in fiscal year 2024, which ended in March, to ₹2.08 billion (roughly $23.6 million), as disclosed in its latest filing. More dramatically, its total revenue across all business lines during that same period jumped to ₹24.50 billion (approximately $279.3 million), representing a forty-nine-fold jump from ₹500 million ($5.7 million) in the previous financial year (FY24). This total revenue figure includes earnings from digital gold transactions, jewelry sales through its Nek platform, and fees from third-party distribution partnerships. The jewelry component is a sizable piece of this diversified approach. Nek launched early last year to offer gold, silver, diamond, and lab-grown diamond jewelry across over 8,000 zip codes. The platform works on a drop-shipment model with zero inventory. It crossed ₹1 billion (approximately $11 million) in annual revenue last year and has been “growing steadily since,” Nishchay said. Jar has been profitable after tax for the last two consecutive quarters, Nishchay told TechCrunch. That growth ties to a bet by the company on a new direction. Until last year, Jar functioned primarily as a distribution platform working with a third-party digital gold provider — essentially acting as a middleman. Since then, it has vertically integrated its operations, building an in-house tech stack to purchase, store, and manage gold directly, with BDO serving as its statutory auditor and Brinks as its custody partner. By controlling the entire value chain, Jar can now capture a larger share of the gold value chain and even distribute its gold through third-party platforms, including the Walmart-owned fintech firm PhonePe . Earlier this year, the Bengaluru-based startup partnered with both BharatPe and Unity Small Finance Bank to let users make digital payments — both to individuals and merchants — directly through the Jar app using India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system. UPI is India’s dominant digital payment network that allows instant bank-to-bank transfers using smartphones. The move opens up a new revenue stream and aims to increase user engagement and retention by broadening the app’s utility beyond just gold savings. Jar has also been an early adopter of UPI AutoPay, a feature introduced by the Indian government in 2020 to enable recurring payments on the UPI platform. The feature has helped the startup, which only supports UPI-based payments for gold savings, drive repeat transactions from users, according to sources familiar with the matter. “Daily savings is our hero feature, and that’s what most of our users use it for,” Nishchay said when asked how UPI AutoPay has contributed to the company’s growth. The app serves a diverse user base, from skilled professionals in IT and manufacturing to small business owners and daily wage workers, such as electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and construction laborers. The app supports nine Indian languages, which the company says helps it cater to users across education and income levels. The startup has also designed its app to offer a personalized experience to users, with gamification and nudges to encourage gold savings. “The growth team consistently built different cohorts to identify the consumer based on a lot of attributes and data signals, based on what phone you use, which location you are operating the phone, from what language, what is your consistent saving pattern, all of those things they take into consideration,” Nishchay said. The startup counts Tiger Global, Tribe Capital, Rocketship VC, Arkam Ventures, and WEH Ventures among its investors. It has raised $63.3 million in funding to date, per Tracxn, and was last valued at more than $300 million.

Numeral raises $35M to automate sales tax with AI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/numeral-raises-35m-to-automate-sales-tax-with-ai/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-18T09:30:00-07:00,"Sam Ross, the co-founder and CEO of Numeral , came up with the idea for his sales tax compliance startup while traveling the world after having worked as a product manager at Airbnb. “This was early 2018, where you didn’t have remote work like you do today,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. Direct-to-consumer businesses were a big trend then, so he supported his travel dreams by running several self-funded e-commerce brands from the road. He operated an online jewelry store and still maintains a vitamin DTC site. While he loved the freedom his businesses offered, Ross (pictured above, left) was perpetually annoyed by the complex and bureaucratic process of handling sales tax on the merchandise he was selling. Until 2018, e-commerce and SaaS (Software as a Service) companies didn’t have to pay sales tax to states where they had customers, but no physical presence. But the Supreme Court ruled later that year that these businesses must collect taxes in the jurisdictions where their customers are located. “All of a sudden, I went from having to deal with collecting tax on my customers in California, to all of a sudden dealing with 40 plus states,” Ross said. “That was painful.” When Ross applied to startup accelerator Y Combinator in 2023, he was encouraged by partner Gustaf Alstromer—his former boss at Airbnb—to build a startup that automates every aspect of sales tax management. On Thursday, Numeral announced that it raised $35 million in Series B funding, valuing the two-year-old company at $350 million. The round, which comes just six months after raising an $18 million Series A , was led by Mayfield, with participation from other investors including Benchmark, Uncork Capital, Y Combinator, and Mantis, the VC firm co-founded by the members of the electronic DJ group The Chainsmokers. While there are many software products for managing sales tax on the market, Ross believed that AI can remove the complexities and serve clients as a human tax accountant would. That includes everything from keeping track of how tax laws are changing in over 11,000 jurisdictions to keeping track of tax-related mail and filing and paying tax on behalf of the client. AI can handle most aspects of sales tax because most of the rules have no ambiguity, so the risk of hallucinations is low. “But some of the laws are pretty crazy,” Ross said. “In New York, if you have a full bagel, it’s tax exempt, but if you cut it in half, it is considered ready to eat, and it becomes taxable.” Numeral’s AI is aware of thousands of such laws. Over the last year, the startup has grown its revenue 3.5 times and now serves over 2,000 software and e-commerce clients, including EightSleep, Graza Olive Oil, and Manus. While managing sales tax may seem niche, there are several startups trying to solve it. Competitors include Anrok, Zamp , and others. And a 26-year-old incumbent, Avalara, owned by Vista Equity Partners, is expected to go public later this year. Ross says that Numeral’s international offering differentiates it from its competitors. “We’re filing taxes for people in Tanzania and Kenya, in all these small markets where traditionally they would have had to use a CPA firm,” he said.

"Nvidia AI chip challenger Groq raises even more than expected, hits $6.9B valuation",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/nvidia-ai-chip-challenger-groq-raises-even-more-than-expected-hits-6-9b-valuation/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-17T16:51:42-07:00,"AI chip startup Groq confirmed Wednesday that it raised a fresh $750 million in funding at a post-money valuation of $6.9 billion. This topped the rumored numbers when word leaked in July that Groq was raising. At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation. Groq, which also sells data center computing power, previously raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates. Groq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq’s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine — specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently. Its products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster. The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google, and OpenAI. Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives. Groq’s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq emerged from stealth . TPUs still power Google Cloud’s AI services. Groq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company talked to TechCrunch a year ago. The new round was led by investment firm Disruptive, with additional funding from BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, and others. Existing investors, including Samsung, Cisco, D1, and Altimeter, also joined the round.

It isn’t your imagination: Google Cloud is flooding the zone,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/it-isnt-your-imagination-google-cloud-is-flooding-the-zone/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T21:41:36-07:00,"The $100 billion partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI, announced Monday, represents — for now — the latest mega-deal reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape. The agreement involves nonvoting shares tied to massive chip purchases and enough computing power for more than 5 million U.S. households, deepening the relationship between two of AI’s most powerful players. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is placing a different bet entirely. While the industry’s biggest players cement ever-tighter partnerships, Google Cloud is hell-bent on capturing the next generation of AI companies before they become too big to court. Francis deSouza, its COO, has seen the AI revolution from multiple vantage points. As the former CEO of genomics giant Illumina, he watched machine learning transform drug discovery. As co-founder of a two-year-old AI alignment startup, Synth Labs, he has grappled with the safety challenges of increasingly powerful models. Now, having joined the C-suite at Google Cloud in January, he’s orchestrating a massive wager on AI’s second wave. It’s a story deSouza likes to tell in numbers. In a conversation with this editor , he notes several times that nine out of the top 10 AI labs use Google’s infrastructure. He also says that nearly all generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud, that 60% of all GenAI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider, and that the company has lined up $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, which represents more than double its current annual run rate. Asked what percentage of Google Cloud’s revenue comes from AI companies, he offers instead that “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups.” The Nvidia-OpenAI deal exemplifies the scale of consolidation sweeping AI infrastructure. Microsoft’s original $1 billion OpenAI investment has grown to nearly $14 billion. Amazon followed with $8 billion in Anthropic investments, securing deep hardware customizations that essentially tailor AI training to work better with Amazon’s infrastructure. Oracle has emerged as a surprise winner, too, landing a $30 billion cloud deal with OpenAI and then securing a jaw-dropping $300 billion five-year commitment starting in 2027. Even Meta, despite building its own infrastructure, signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud while planning $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure spending through 2028. The Trump administration’s $500 billion “Stargate” project, involving SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships. These gigantic deals might seem threatening for Google, given the partnerships that companies like OpenAI and Nvidia appear to be cementing elsewhere. In fact, it looks a lot like Google is being cut out of some frenzied dealmaking. But the corporate behemoth isn’t exactly sitting on its hands. Instead, Google Cloud is signing smaller companies like Lovable and Windsurf — what deSouza calls the “next generation of companies coming up,” without major up-front investments. The strategy extends beyond simple customer acquisition. Google offers AI startups $350,000 in cloud credits, access to its technical teams, and go-to-market support through its marketplace. Google Cloud also provides what deSouza describes as a “no compromise” AI stack — from chips to models to applications — with an “open ethos” that gives customers choice at every layer. The approach reflects both opportunity and necessity. In a market where companies can go “from being a startup to being a multibillion-dollar company in a very short period of time,” as deSouza puts it, capturing future unicorns before they mature could prove more valuable than fighting over today’s giants. “Companies love the fact that they can get access to our AI stack, they can get access to our teams to understand where our technologies are going,” deSouza says during our interview. “They also love that they’re getting access to enterprise-grade Google class infrastructure.” Google’s infrastructure play got even more ambitious recently, with reporting revealing the company’s behind-the-scenes maneuvering to expand its custom AI chip business. According to The Information , Google has struck deals to place its tensor processing units (TPUs) in other cloud providers’ data centers for the first time, including an agreement with London-based Fluidstack that includes up to $3.2 billion in financial backing for a New York facility. Competing directly with AI companies while simultaneously providing them infrastructure requires … finesse. Google Cloud provides TPU chips to OpenAI and hosts Anthropic’s Claude model through its Vertex AI platform, even as its own Gemini models compete head-to-head with both. (Google Cloud’s parent company, Alphabet, also owns a 14% stake in Anthropic, per New York Times court documents obtained earlier this year, though when asked directly about Google’s financial relationship with Anthropic, deSouza calls the relationship a “multi-layered partnership,” then quickly redirects me to Google Cloud’s model marketplace, noting that customers can access various foundation models.) But if Google is trying to be Switzerland while advancing its own agenda, it has had plenty of practice. The approach has roots in Google’s open source contributions, from Kubernetes to the foundational “ Attention Is All You Need ” paper that enabled the transformer architecture underlying most modern AI. More recently, Google published an open source protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A) for interagent communication in an attempt to demonstrate its continued commitment to openness even in competitive areas. “We have made the explicit choice over the years to be open at every layer of the stack, and we know that this means companies can absolutely take our technology and use it to build a competitor at the next layer,” deSouza acknowledges. “That’s been happening for decades. That’s something we are okay with.” Google Cloud’s courtship of startups comes at a particularly interesting moment. Just this month, federal judge Amit Mehta delivered a nuanced ruling in the government’s five-year-old search monopoly case, attempting to curb Google’s dominance without hampering its AI ambitions. While Google avoided the Justice Department’s most severe proposed penalties, including the forced divestment of its Chrome browser, the ruling underscored regulatory concerns about the company leveraging its search monopoly to dominate AI. Critics are worried, understandably, that Google’s vast trove of search data provides an unfair advantage in developing AI systems and that the company could deploy the same monopolistic tactics that secured its search dominance. In conversation, deSouza is focused on far more positive outcomes. “I think we have an opportunity to fundamentally understand some of the major diseases that today we just don’t have a good understanding of,” deSouza says, for example, outlining a vision where Google Cloud helps power research into Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and climate technologies. “We want to work very hard to make sure that we are pioneering the technologies that will enable that work.” Critics may not easily be assuaged. By positioning itself as an open platform that empowers rather than controls the next generation of AI companies, Google Cloud may be showing regulators that it fosters competition rather than stifles it, all while forging relationships with startups that might help Google’s case if regulators ramp up pressure. For our full chat with deSouza, check out this week’s StrictlyVC Download podcast; a new episode comes out every Tuesday. Also, note a correction made as of 9/26: We misquoted deSouza as calling Google Cloud the “primary” computing partner of startups Windsurf and Lovable; we apologize for the oversight.

"Neon, the No. 2 social app on the Apple App Store, pays users to record their phone calls and sells data to AI firms",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T12:50:58-07:00,"A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple’s U.S. App Store’s Social Networking section. The app, Neon Mobile , pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations. Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures . On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps. Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app. According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user. That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.” The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society. Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a: …worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed. That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims. The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs. Though Neon’s app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. “Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome ‘s Privacy, Security & Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch. “Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it … It’s an interesting approach,” says Daniels. Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed — and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users’ calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript. In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. Neon claims it removes users’ names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices. “Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.” Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be. In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user’s call, nor did it warn the call recipient. The app worked like any other voice-over-IP app, and the caller ID displayed the inbound phone number, as usual. (We’ll leave it to security researchers to attempt to verify the app’s other claims.) Neon founder Alex Kiam didn’t return a request for comment. Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows. A LinkedIn post indicates Kiam raised money from Upfront Ventures a few months ago for his startup, but the investor didn’t respond to an inquiry from TechCrunch as of the time of writing. There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them , it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps , which often aren’t as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that’s “commercially available” on the market. Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch. In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others’ privacy at risk when they do. “There is a tremendous desire on the part of, certainly, knowledge workers — and frankly, everybody — to make it as easy as possible to do your job,” says Jackson. “And some of these productivity tools do that at the expense of, obviously, your privacy, but also, increasingly, the privacy of those with whom you are interacting on a day-to-day basis.”  Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Kiam, Jackson, Daniels, mobile apps, Jennifer Daniels, Alex Kiam, Peter Jackson, Neon, App Store, Recordings","Security & Data Protection Group, TechCrunch, Apple, AI, Daniels, iPhone, Upfront Ventures, Greenberg Glusker, Neon, Blank Rome ‘s, Neon Mobile, LinkedIn, Social Networking",$30 ,,AI
"Trump hits H-1B visas with $100,000 fee, targeting the program that launched Elon Musk and Instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-mu***REMOVED***/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T12:13:20-07:00,"President Trump just made it a lot more expensive for companies to hire foreign workers through the H-1B program. The White House announced Friday that Trump signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a hefty $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, an enormous jump from the current $215 lottery registration fee. H-1B visas allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in fields that typically require technical expertise like IT, engineering, mathematics, or medicine. The program is capped at 65,000 new visas annually, plus an additional 20,000 for foreign graduates with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. The visas are awarded through a lottery system and typically last three years, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. The administration’s new move is designed to crack down on what it calls widespread abuse of the program, which it blames for displacing American workers. According to the White House, the share of IT workers with H-1B visas has skyrocketed from 32% in 2003 to over 65% today, while unemployment among recent computer science graduates has hit 6.1%. Silicon Valley will undoubtedly be up in arms over the initiative. The restrictions take aim at a program that helped create some of the region’s biggest success stories. Elon Musk, Trump’s close ally for most of this year, initially worked in the U.S. on an H-1B after arriving as a student. In fact, Musk, taking issue with a perceived critic of the H-1B program in December on his platform X, tweeted to the individual that, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B. Take a big step back and F*** YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder-turned-chief-product-officer at AI giant Anthropic, is one of those aforementioned success stories. The Brazilian-born Stanford grad worked at the early instant messaging platform Meebo on an H-1B visa. Earlier this year, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) argued in a letter to the National Science Foundation: “Raising the annual cap of H-1B visas issued each year to educated and highly skilled immigrants who work in jobs that require a substantial amount of technical and specialized training is fundamental to generating more successful immigrant-founded companies.” The NVCA noted that while “H-1B visas are not ideal for immigrants who want to immediately found companies in the U.S., they are still critically important for the success of immigrant founded companies because they provide valuable work experience and widen the pipeline of potential immigrant startup founders.” (The H-1B’s employer-employee requirement makes it practically impossible for founders to obtain directly, forcing them to spend years tied to employers before getting green cards that let them launch their own startups. When Krieger wanted to co-found Instagram in 2010, transferring his visa took months, and he has said he almost abandoned the startup before it launched due to those complications.) On Friday, tech leaders on X were already warning about talent fleeing to more welcoming countries. And Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have reportedly told employees with H-1B visas to avoid foreign travel and remain in the United states for now . In the meantime, in its proclamation on Friday, the Trump administration went full bore on its criticism of the program, pointing to specific companies that approved thousands of H-1B workers while simultaneously laying off American employees. According to the White House fact sheet, one unnamed company received approval for 5,189 H-1B workers this fiscal year while cutting roughly 16,000 U.S. jobs. The proclamation —  which says it is partly rooted in an effort to “protect our national security” —  includes wiggle room; case-by-case exemptions are possible if deemed in the national interest. It also directs the labor secretary to revise wage requirements to prevent undercutting American salaries. This post has been updated to include reports on how Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are responding.

"Updates to Studio, YouTube Live, new GenAI tools, and everything else announced at Made on YouTube",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/updates-to-studio-youtube-live-new-gen-ai-tools-and-everything-else-announced-at-made-on-youtube/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T08:00:00-07:00,"At its annual Made on YouTube event this week, YouTube unveiled tons of new updates, features, and tools geared toward creators, including updates to YouTube Live, new ways to monetize, and more. Studio updates include “likeness” detection and lip-synced dubs, and the company is offering new AI tools for podcasters to help promote their shows. Here’s everything announced at Made on YouTube. The company showed off new and updated tools to Studio , which creators use to manage their channels and track analytics. Updates include an inspiration tab, title A/B testing features, auto dubbing, and more. What caught our attention is the “likeness”-detection feature, which was announced last year and made available to a few creators; it’s now in open beta. People will be able to detect, manage, and flag for removal any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness. An AI-powered Ask Studio can guide users and answer questions about their account, and creators will be able to collaborate with up to five other people on one video, which is available to the audiences of all the participating video makers. YouTube gave Live, its livestreaming platform , some updates as well, like letting creators play minigames to entertain viewers, broadcasting simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical formats, providing AI-powered highlights, reacting to live events, using a new ad format, and more. The AI-powered highlights automatically select the best moments from a livestream to turn them into shareable Shorts, and a new ad format — called “side-by-side” — runs adjacent to the main content, similar to a split-screen display, rather than interrupting the stream. YouTube is bringing a custom version of Veo 3 , Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, to Shorts, as well as a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and more. With Veo 3 Fast, as the custom version is called, creators can apply motion from a video to an image, add different styles to their videos, and insert objects into the video with a simple text prompt. Creators can also transform the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for other Shorts using Google’s AI music model, Lyria 2. YouTube Music got some updates as well , designed to deepen engagement between creators and their fans. These include a countdown timer for new releases and a chance to offer fans “thank you” videos, and the company is testing a pilot program for U.S. listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists. Video podcast creators in the U.S. will be able to create clips more easily with AI suggestions , according to YouTube. And a new feature rolling out next year will offer a way to turn audio podcasts into video podcasts YouTube is giving creators new ways to monetize , with brand deals and through the YouTube Shopping program, which lets creators earn money by featuring and tagging products in their content. YouTube will also now allow creators to swap out brand sponsorships in long-form videos. In addition, creators can take advantage of auto timestamps for product tags, auto tagging for eligible items mentioned in videos, and a new brand link feature for Shorts. An AI-powered system will help identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time. Shorts creators will soon be able to add a link to a brand’s site specifically for brand deals, and YouTube will proactively suggest creators who may be a good fit for brands in its creator partnerships hub.

"Google isn’t kidding around about cost cutting, even slashing its FT subscription",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/google-isnt-kidding-around-about-cost-cutting-even-slashing-its-ft-subscription/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T22:25:49-07:00,"Google is ending its enterprise subscription to the Financial Times, and it’s not the only enterprise media subscription on the chopping block, sources say. The cuts reflect broader cost-reduction efforts at the search giant, even as the company reports strong financial performance. Google has been implementing cost reductions across 2025, including eliminating 35% of managers who oversee teams of three people or fewer, and offering voluntary exit programs across multiple divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi signaled late last year that the company would continue to push cost cuts “a little further,” a mandate that appears unchanged despite Alphabet reporting strong Q2 2025 results with $96.4 billion in revenue. These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers. August data from the trade association Digital Content Next showed median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers fell 10% between May and June of this year, with non-news brands experiencing 14% drops. Major outlets, including CNN, Business Insider, and HuffPost have reportedly seen even sharper traffic declines (of 30%, 40%, and 40% , respectively), according to data from SimilarWeb. Publishers attribute these declines largely to Google’s AI Overviews feature, which has reduced click-throughs to external websites from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to Pew Research. This spring, Pew analyzed data from 900 U.S. adults, six in 10 of whom conducted at least one Google search in March 2025 that produced an AI-generated summary. A Google spokesperson responded to this story after publication, stating: “The claim that this is due to a change in our commitment to news partnerships is patently false. Our partnerships regularly evolve, and we have partnerships in place with more than 2800 publications worldwide and we’ve made billions of dollars in payments directly to publishers, platforms and content providers.” The traffic decline comes as Google has largely resisted content licensing, unlike rival OpenAI, which has signed deals with numerous major publishers, including The Financial Times , News Corp , and Axel Springer. So far at least, Google has struck few deals, including one with the Associated Press and an annual Reddit agreement reportedly worth $60 million per year. (According to a new Bloomberg report , Reddit is now looking to renegotiate its contracts with both Google and OpenAI, with Bloomberg suggesting that Reddit sees its prominent role in search results and generative AI training as even more valuable than it first understood.) Google reportedly began exploratory talks with 20 outlets about more content licensing deals this summer. Still, some might see Google canceling its FT subscription as akin to a plagiarist refusing to buy the textbook they’re copying from. At a Fortune event earlier this month, the CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. — Neil Vogel of People Inc. — didn’t hold his punches, calling Google a “ bad actor ” and accusing it of using the same bot to crawl websites for its search engine as it does to support its AI features. While Google’s approach to AI training has differed from other AI players, the company does offer publishers ways to opt out of having their data used without affecting search access. “For a long time,” Vogel said at the event, “the deal was: ‘Take our content, build your search engine, send us back traffic’. That deal’s off.” In a separate, scathing op-ed this summer, Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint wrote that Google’s AI overviews are creating a “zero-click” environment where “ all traffic dead ends at Google .” Editor’s note: This story has been updated post-publication to include a statement from Google and to correct an inaccurate characterization of Google’s AI training policies. The original story incorrectly stated that publishers cannot block Google’s AI systems without also forfeiting search traffic. Google offers an opt-out option that allows publishers to block AI training while maintaining search access.

Meta CTO explains why the smart glasses demos failed at Meta Connect — and it wasn’t the Wi-Fi,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-cto-explains-why-the-smart-glasses-demos-failed-at-meta-connect-and-it-wasnt-the-wi-fi/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T09:04:11-07:00,"Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth took to his Instagram to explain, in more technical detail, why multiple demos of Meta’s new smart glasses technology failed at Meta Connect, the company’s developer conference, this week. Meta on Wednesday introduced three new pairs of smart glasses, including an upgraded version of its existing Ray-Ban Meta, a new Meta Ray-Ban Display that comes with a wristband controller, and the sports-focused Oakley Meta Vanguard . However, at different points during the event, the live technology demos failed to work. In one, cooking content creator Jack Mancuso asked his Ray-Ban Meta glasses how to get started with a particular sauce recipe. After repeating the question, “What do I do first?” with no response, the AI skipped ahead in the recipe, forcing him to stop the demo. He then tossed it back to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that he thinks the Wi-Fi may be messed up. In another demo, the glasses failed to pick up a live WhatsApp video call between Bosworth and Zuckerberg; Zuckerberg eventually had to give up. Bosworth walked onstage, joking about the “brutal” Wi-Fi. “You practice these things like a hundred times, and then you never know what’s gonna happen,” Zuckerberg said at the time. After the event, Bosworth took to his Instagram for a Q&A session about the new tech and the live demo failures. On the latter, he explained that it wasn’t actually the Wi-Fi that caused the issue with the chef’s glasses. Instead, it was a mistake in resource management planning. “When the chef said, ‘Hey, Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Ray-Ban Meta’s Live AI in the building. And there were a lot of people in that building,” Bosworth explained. “That obviously didn’t happen in rehearsal; we didn’t have as many things,” he said, referring to the number of glasses that were triggered. That alone wasn’t enough to cause the disruption, though. The second part of the failure had to do with how Meta had chosen to route the Live AI traffic to its development server to isolate it during the demo. But when it did so, it did this for everyone in the building on the access points, which included all the headsets. “So we DDoS’d ourselves, basically, with that demo,” Bosworth added. (A DDoS attack, or a distributed denial of service attack, is one where a flood of traffic overwhelms a server or service, slowing it down or making it unavailable. In this case, Meta’s dev server wasn’t set up to handle the flood of traffic from the other glasses in the building — Meta was only planning for it to handle the demos alone.) The issue with the failed WhatsApp call, on the other hand, was the result of a new bug. The smart glasses’ display had gone to sleep at the exact moment the call came in, Bosworth said. When Zuckerberg woke the display back up, it didn’t show the answer notification to him. The CTO said this was a “race condition” bug, or where the outcome depends on the unpredictable and uncoordinated timing of two or more different processes trying to use the same resource simultaneously. “We’ve never run into that bug before,” Bosworth noted. “That’s the first time we’d ever seen it. It’s fixed now, and that’s a terrible, terrible place for that bug to show up.” He stressed that, of course, Meta knows how to handle video calls, and the company was “bummed” about the bug showing up here. Despite the issues, Bosworth said he’s not worried about the results of the glitches. “Obviously, I don’t love it, but I know the product works. I know it has the goods. So it really was just a demo fail and not, like, a product failure,” he said.

How AI startups are fueling Google’s booming cloud business,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-18T13:53:33-07:00,"Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers. Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as one of their cloud computing providers, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud tells TechCrunch that it handles a significant percentage of Lovable and Windsurf’s cloud and AI workloads today, though the startups are not contractually obligated to primarily work with Google. The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future. Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum. Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023. Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI , and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud. While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition , spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment. Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin. In an interview with TechCrunch, Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said the startup works with a variety of cloud providers, including Google Cloud, but it’s hard to say which company it uses the most. Lovable declined to comment. The significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it’s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research. The company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder’s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named. Part of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program. Update 9/19/25: This article has been updated to clarify language around the term “primary cloud computing provider” and include comment from Windsurf’s CEO. Neither Lovable nor Windsurf have signed a preferred cloud provider agreement, a contractual designation that guarantees a startup does a majority of their work with a single cloud provider.

Kleiner Perkins-backed voice AI startup Keplar aims to replace traditional market research,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/kleiner-perkins-backed-voice-ai-startup-keplar-aims-to-replace-traditional-market-research/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-17T12:54:17-07:00,"For decades, Fortune 500 companies had to hire market research firms to get meaningful insights into customer satisfaction. These services come with a hefty price tag and often take weeks to complete. Keplar , a market research startup, uses voice AI to conduct customer interviews, providing clients with analysis much faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research consulting firms. On Wednesday, the two-year-old company announced that it raised $3.4 million in seed funding led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from SV Angel, Common Metal, and South Park Commons. The idea for Keplar was conceived in 2023 when Dhruv Guliani (above right), previously an engineer at Google, where he worked on speech and voice AI models, and machine learning engineer William Wen, participated in the South Park Commons founder fellowship program. The duo spoke with market researchers and brand managers and realized that the tools these professionals rely on — written surveys and interviews conducted by humans — can now be replaced by conversational AI. With Keplar, companies can set up studies in minutes, Guliani told TechCrunch. The startup’s platform can turn any question about the product into an interview moderation guide. Keplar’s voice assistant will then reach out to participants and will ask them probing questions to understand what customers like and dislike about the product. If Keplar is granted access to the client’s CRM, the AI voice researcher will reach out to existing customers. The results of AI conversations are then packaged into reports and PowerPoint presentations, similar to those traditionally provided by human market researchers. Relying on voice bots before advancements in LLMs would not have been possible. But voice AI has become so good that study participants sometimes forget they are speaking to AI, Guliani said. “These conversations feel really real. When you play everything back, you can even hear participants address the AI moderator by name: Ellie, Andrew or Ryan.” The startup’s customers include Clorox and Intercom. Keplar isn’t the only AI company trying to disrupt the customer research market. Larger competitors include Outset, which raised a $17 million Series A led by 8VC in June, and Listen Labs, which raised $27 million from Sequoia in April.

Airbuds is the music social network Apple and Spotify wish they had built,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/airbuds-is-the-music-social-network-apple-and-spotify-wish-they-had-built/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-17T09:36:38-07:00,"A new social network has been quietly blowing up with Gen Z and younger, and it’s not from Meta. San Francisco-based Airbuds offers a mobile, social app that lets people express themselves through their music. Users can share what they’re streaming with friends through a smartphone widget that works with a range of streaming services. On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings. For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place. That’s a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping , which closed down in the early 2010s and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect also didn’t last .) Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds , comments , polls and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories , collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more. Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable. Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab , they’ve had time to iterate on their ideas. Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon’s Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that lets friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017 . After the Cappuccino team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds. “Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it’s a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming. “Basically, it’s effortless. You just connect your Spotify, and then every time you’re going to listen to something on Spotify, it’s going to be shared on Airbuds in real time,” he says. Today, Airbuds supports Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Musi, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Audiomack. While Airbuds’ core functionality remains the widget, the app has built on top of that experience to offer a range of other social features. Users can react to their friends’ streamed songs with emojis, stickers, or selfies clipped out from photos with the background removed. As users scroll the app’s feed, they can play clips of their friends’ streamed songs and even chat with a friend through a simple, built-in messenger. When you want to stream your music but not share it, there’s a “ghost mode” option to keep your listening private until it’s disabled. Airbuds will also display friends with similar music tastes and deliver a personalized Weekly Recap of what you streamed, like a miniature version of Spotify’s popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it’s experimenting with a new feature that would let users join their school on the app to see the top artists from their schoolmates. Users can also customize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite artists, songs, albums, lyrics, pictures, text, and more, or let the app automatically design it for them. This self-expression feature is key to the app’s traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app’s features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming. The streamers, he said, “gave us access to 100 million songs, but nobody really cracked the identity piece, the self-expression piece … and this is exactly how they use it,” referring to Airbuds’ young users, who are mostly high schoolers and college students in the U.S. (The app also has some traction in the U.K., Australia, Brazil, and Mexico.) However, some of Airbuds’ traction can be chalked up to its feature-gating, which requires users to invite friends to gain access to some of the app’s functionality. For example, you have to invite friends to see more than your top 3 artists in the recap. But Poupardin stresses it’s not just for growth — the app only really works if you add your friends. With the new funding in hand, Airbuds is planning other ways to expand its app, potentially by supporting other types of streaming services, providing artist-to-fan connections, or designing features to attract older users. The team is also testing a subscription feature. To date, the startup has raised a total of $10 million from investors, including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital. Airbuds is available on iOS and Android .

Icarus raises $6.1M to take on space’s ‘warehouse work’ with embodied-AI robots,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/icarus-raises-6-1m-to-take-on-spaces-warehouse-work-with-embodied-ai-robots/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-17T06:00:00-07:00,"Icarus Robotics co-founders Ethan Barajas and Jamie Palmer spent hours interviewing astronauts about what it was like working in space as they homed in on their startup idea. Their big takeaway: The work was often more cargo logistics than cutting-edge science. “We’re Amazon warehouse workers with PhDs,” one astronaut said. If an experiment takes two hours on station, the person continued, the first 90 minutes are spent just moving around cargo and preparing tools. It’s a dismal waste of top talent. “These astronauts that are trained for two years, that come from some of the craziest military backgrounds and some of the smartest, most trained people on Earth, spend 14 days unpacking, repacking those back, just moving them around,” Barajas said. The logistical burden is tied to cargo resupply. Every 60 days or so, roughly three-and-a-half tons of cargo arrive at the International Space Station, and all of it must be unpacked and stowed. Barajas and Palmer, who met at the Entrepreneurs First organization, knew there had to be a better way. Their pitch: use intelligent, dexterous robots to take over these time-sucking chores. But they’re not starting with humanoid robots. Instead, Icarus is taking an iterative approach and starting with a simpler, fan-propelled robot with two robot arms outfitted with jaw grippers. Icarus just raised a $6.1 million seed round led by Soma Capital and Xtal, with participation from Nebular and Massive Tech Ventures to get there. The look of the first robot is a function of the tasks it will do: unpacking and stowing cargo. Palmer, who brings the robotics expertise to the enterprise, said that when you move to bimanual manipulation, or the coordinated use of two robotic arms at once, you can get around 80% of the needed dexterity with simple jaw grippers as with a complex anthropomorphic hand.  A lot of the science experiments astronauts perform on the ISS are also fairly simple in practice, like swapping out cartridges, which is another area a robotic labor force could come in handy. The team recently performed a terrestrial long-distance teleoperation demo with a bimanual jaw gripper system, unzipping a real ISS cargo bag, unpacking it, and zipping it back up again. “We were able to demonstrate that you don’t need to go the whole way to hands to get meaningful dexterity at a long distance,” Palmer said. Next up is flight testing. Icarus plans to conduct a parabolic-flight campaign in the new year, followed by a one-year demonstration on the ISS via Voyager Space, operator of the commercial Bishop airlock. The plan is to spend a year de-risking the full suite of cargo bag operations, then step into finer-grained tasks related to station maintenance, like filter and seal inspections. The robots will be teleoperated at first, and Palmer said the ISS is one of the few work sites where you can justify having someone “behind the wheel” of the robot at all times. “The labor arbitrage margin is so big” that Icarus can have a skilled, high-paid robotic operator for a year, he said. Icarus’ long-term plan is to build autonomy and general-purpose capability via “embodied AI.” It mirrors what’s happening in terrestrial general purpose robotics on the ground, adjusted for the physics of microgravity. This means collecting data in microgravity with a human in the loop and turning that dataset into the foundational models for on orbit robotics. From there, Icarus aims to roll out partial autonomy where a human selects “higher-level primitives,” a set of commands that are simplified into intelligent commands like “open the bag” or “unstow the items.” Ultimately, the goal is full autonomy for deep space locales where teleoperation isn’t viable, to complement human space activity. “We don’t want to remove the astronauts,” said Barajas, who brings the space experience, having landed his first NASA internship at just 17 years old. “We want to augment them. We want to make the short time that they have on station as profitable and as research-heavy as possible.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Voyager Space, Icarus, Ethan Barajas, Jamie Palmer, Icarus Robotics","TechCrunch, Barajas, Massive Tech Ventures, NASA, Nebular, Palmer, Soma Capital, Amazon, ISS, Bishop",$6.1 m,,AI
Google Ventures doubles down on dev tool startup Blacksmith just 4 months after its seed round,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/google-ventures-doubles-down-on-dev-tool-startup-blacksmith-just-4-months-after-its-seed-round/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-17T04:00:00-07:00,"As speed becomes the defining currency in an AI-driven software world, Blacksmith has raised another round led by Google Ventures — just four months after its seed — to accelerate how code gets shipped. The $10 million Series A closed in just 14 days, with Google Ventures doubling down after first backing Blacksmith’s $3.5 million seed in May. At the time, Alphabet’s VC arm bet on the size of the market and the founding team, which included veterans of Cockroach Labs, another GV portfolio company. But for this round, GV was swayed by results. Blacksmith, which offers a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for developers that complements GitHub actions, had pulled in hundreds of customers since May, and the boom in AI coding agents has blown the market wide open, co-founder and CEO Aditya Jayaprakash (pictured above on the left) said in an exclusive interview. The San Francisco–based startup hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in February with just four people — Jayaprakash, co-founders Aayush Shah and Aditya Maru, and a product designer. Since then, revenue has reached $3.5 million ARR with more than 700 customers, supported by a team of eight, and the company is aiming to double that figure by year’s end, Jayaprakash told TechCrunch. Founded in January 2024, Blacksmith was born from the experiences of its founders, who met at the University of Waterloo before building large-scale distributed systems at Faire and Cockroach Labs. There, they saw firsthand how costly and unpredictable the build and unit testing stages of software releases, known as continuous integration (CI), can be. You would have to spin up hundreds of machines and burn through hundreds of hours of computing power just to test new code before shipping it, Jayaprakash said. A typical software development process involves developers continuously pushing new code into repositories such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. To manage the testing and integration of that code, cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure all offer their own solutions — but these are often slower, costlier, or less predictable than teams need. Unlike many rivals that rent generic cloud servers from cloud providers like AWS, Blacksmith’s service runs on  high-performance, gaming-grade CPUs. The result, the startup says, is up to double the processing speed and lowering, by as much as 75%, compute costs. And because teams can switch by changing just a single line of code, they can start shipping faster within minutes. “Because we’re going the bare-metal route, we have much better control over our economics compared to the hyperscalers,” Jayaprakash told TechCrunch. “I’m not saying every company should go bare metal… but if you are a compute company, if you are an infra company, where your bread and butter is compute, like ourselves, it makes a lot of sense, and it gives us abundant control over our margins.” By using hardware at its premises, the startup improves its margins as it grows its customer base, the founder said. Blacksmith also offers test analytics and an observability roadmap, giving customers deeper insights into GitHub Actions — GitHub’s CI/CD platform that automates how developers test and deploy software. Blacksmith targets companies with teams of 500 engineers or more. Customers already running their GitHub Actions through the platform include Ashby, Chroma, Clerk, Devsisters, Mintlify, Pylon, Slope, Supabase, and VEED. The latest funding round also saw participation from existing investors and angels, including Spencer Kimball, CEO of Cockroach Labs, and David Cramer, co-founder of Sentry. Blacksmith launched out of Y Combinator’s Winter 2024 batch and today has a team of 11.

"Groww, backed by Satya Nadella, set to become first Indian startup to go public after US-to-India move",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/groww-backed-by-satya-nadella-set-to-become-first-indian-startup-to-go-public-after-u-s-to-india-move/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-16T18:32:17-07:00,"Groww , India’s largest retail brokerage firm, is set to test the country’s public markets with a multibillion-dollar IPO. The listing comes just over a year after the company restructured its corporate headquarters from Delaware back to India — a move that could make it the first Indian startup to list at home following a relocation from the U.S. Backed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and marquee investors including Peak XV Partners, Y Combinator, Ribbit Capital, and Tiger Global, Groww’s listing — expected later this year — is set to double as a major exit opportunity for global venture funds. The four investment firms are offloading about 394 million shares — roughly 9.4% of Groww’s total equity base — per the draft IPO documents filed on Tuesday. That makes them the single largest selling bloc, accounting for about 69% of all shares being offered to the public. Pine Labs , Razorpay , Meesho , and Zepto are among the Indian startups that have recently shifted their base back home. Walmart-backed PhonePe relocated its headquarters from Singapore to India in 2022, while Flipkart — once its parent and also backed by Walmart — similarly announced plans to move its headquarters from Singapore to India earlier this year. Last year, Groww became one of the first startups to shift its headquarters back to India from the U.S. The startup paid around $159 million in taxes as part of the move. Relocating their base back home helps startups align with evolving local regulations and meet requirements for domestic stock listings. It also makes sense to tap India’s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs. The trend reflects the growing maturity and attractiveness of India’s capital markets compared to overseas alternatives. While U.S. investors plan to offload a large chunk of their holdings in Groww, founders Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh, and Ishan Bansal together are selling only about 4 million shares — only 0.7% of the total offer for sale, per the draft prospectus. The small sale signals that Groww’s founders are holding on to nearly all their equity, in contrast to the established investors who are using the IPO as an exit route. Groww plans to raise ₹10.6 billion (approximately $121 million) in new funding from the IPO, along with the secondary sale of 574 million shares by existing shareholders, expected to be priced at ₹5-6 billion (roughly $568-$682 million). The IPO is expected to value the Bengaluru-based company at $9 billion. In the fiscal year ending March 31, Groww reported total income of ₹40.6 billion (about $462 million), up 45% year-on-year, with profit after tax of ₹18.2 billion (roughly $208 million). The startup had posted a net loss of about ₹8 billion (around $92 million) in the previous year, primarily due to expenses tied to its Delaware headquarters relocation. As of June, Groww had about 37.4 million individual demat accounts (digital accounts that hold securities electronically), representing nearly 19% of India’s market, along with 12.6 million active clients on the National Stock Exchange, equal to a 26% share. The platform also counted around 17 million active systematic investment plans (SIPs, which are recurring monthly investments) and 9 million unique mutual fund investors, becoming the only investment app in the country to surpass 100 million cumulative downloads. The offering is being advised by JPMorgan Chase, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citigroup, Axis Bank, and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors.

"Same-day delivery comes to space, as Impulse promises satellite transport in hours, not months",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/same-day-delivery-comes-to-space-as-impulse-promises-satellite-transport-in-hours-not-months/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-16T13:07:15-07:00,"Amazon made same-day delivery the benchmark on Earth. Impulse Space is pitching a similar concept for satellites bound for geostationary orbit about 22,000 miles above Earth, compressing what is typically a months-long transit into a matter of hours. In the span of a week, the in-space propulsion startup announced a trio of deals aiming to unlock geostationary orbit (GEO) for commercial and defense users. That includes a demonstration mission with defense contractor Anduril planned for 2026; a transportation deal with GEO communications startup Astranis in 2027; and a multi-launch agreement to carry Infinite Orbits’ servicing satellites to GEO starting the same year. Tom Mueller founded Impulse in 2021 after nearly two decades leading propulsion at SpaceX , where he led development of the Merlin and Raptor engines. He left SpaceX in 2020 and started Impulse to build out in-space transport services focused on last-mile delivery in low Earth orbit (LEO) — which is typically 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth —  and ultra-fast satellite transport to GEO. The common denominator across these missions is Helios, Impulse’s methane-oxygen kick stage. A kick stage is essentially a small rocket engine system that rides on a larger rocket and then fires its own engine — in this case, a powerful engine called Deneb — to propel spacecraft to their final destination. Helios is meant to be the “same day” courier from LEO to higher altitude orbits. If it performs as advertised, commercial operators could reach higher orbits much faster, and the Department of Defense could maneuver more quickly in an increasingly contested region of space. GEO isn’t just far away. Getting there and operating satellites from there presents special challenges. Spacecraft must transit the high-radiation Van Allen belts (zones of charged particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field), deal with latency in long-distance communication, and maintain their precise position. The partnership between Anduril and Impulse could prove especially lucrative. The pair will jointly build a demo satellite for rendezvous and proximity operations — a capability that allows spacecraft to approach and inspect other objects in orbit — which the Space Force has identified as critical for space domain awareness and deterrence. Impulse is supplying the spacecraft — called Mira, which flew for the first time last year — while Anduril will provide a mission data processor, long-wave infrared imager, and other software-defined payloads aimed at tracking and high-precision navigation. As part of the demo, Helios will ferry the spacecraft to GEO in under a day, after which the mission aims to capture images of other resident space objects, analyze them, and autonomously execute precise maneuvers to observe the objects. U.S. officials often describe the goal as “maneuvering without regret,” or the ability to reposition satellites on orbit without jeopardizing the mission or wasting costly fuel. On the commercial side, Astranis signed on for a 2027 mission that would see its MicroGEO satellites launched to LEO on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and then delivered to geostationary orbit in less than 24 hours by Helios. That mission profile is super valuable to Astranis, as it will allow the company to dramatically accelerate satellite activation dates for customers waiting for their satellite broadband services here on Earth. Finally, Impulse signed a multi-launch agreement with France’s Infinite Orbits to carry several satellite servicing spacecraft to GEO via a rideshare program called Caravan. Impulse says the Caravan offering will deliver multiple small satellites at the same time, much as SpaceX’s rideshare program lets companies split the cost of a launch. The first Caravan mission is fully booked for 2026, Impulse said. In recent years, the space industry’s explosive growth has mostly focused on LEO as operators shifted to smaller, less expensive satellites for applications in communications and remote sensing. But if Impulse has its way, the next phase of growth will be in GEO.

"CodeRabbit raises $60M, valuing the 2-year-old AI code review startup at $550M",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/coderabbit-raises-60m-valuing-the-2-year-old-ai-code-review-startup-at-550m/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-16T12:00:00-07:00,"Harjot Gill was running FluxNinja, an observability startup he co-founded several years after selling his first startup Netsil to Nutanix in 2018, when he noticed a curious trend. “We had a team of remote engineers who were starting to adopt AI code generation on GitHub Copilot,” Gill told TechCrunch. “We saw that adoption happen, and it was very clear to me that as a second-order effect, it’s going to cause bottlenecks in the code review.” In early 2023, Gill started CodeRabbit, an AI-powered code review platform, and it acquired FlexNinja. Gill’s prediction has come true: Developers are now regularly using AI coding assistants to generate code, but the output is often buggy, forcing engineers to spend a lot of time on corrections . CodeRabbit can help catch some of the errors. The business has been growing 20% a month and is now making more than $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), according to Gill. Investors find the startup’s growth exciting. On Tuesday, CodeRabbit announced that it raised a $60 million Series B, valuing the company at $550 million. The round, which brought the startup’s total funding to $88 million, was led by Scale Venture Partners with participation of NVentures, Nvidia’s venture capital arm, and returning investors including CRV. CodeRabbit is helping companies like Chegg, Groupon, and Mercury, along with over 8,000 other businesses, save time on the famously frustrating task of code review, which has become even more time-consuming with the rise of AI-generated code. Since CodeRabbit understands a company’s codebase, it can identify bugs and provide feedback, acting like a coworker, Gill said. He added that companies using CodeRabbit can cut the number of humans working on code-review by half. As with most areas of AI, CodeRabbit has competition. Startup rivals include Graphite , which secured a $52 million Series B led by Accel earlier this year, and Greptile, which we reported is in talks for a $30 million Series A round with Benchmark. While leading AI coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude Code and Cursor also offer AI-powered code review capabilities, Gill is betting that customers will prefer a standalone offering in the long term. “CodeRabbit is a lot more comprehensive in terms of depth and technical breadth than bundled solutions,” he said. Whether his prediction will turn out to be correct remains to be seen. But for now, thousands of developers are clearly happy to pay CodeRabbit $30 a month. Even with the growing popularity of AI code review tools like CodeRabbit, AI solutions still can’t yet be fully trusted to fix the bugs and “unusable” code written by AI. The unreliability of AI-generated code has given rise to a new corporate role: the vibe code cleanup specialist.

Andrew Yang took inspiration from Mark Cuban for his budget cell carrier Noble Mobile,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/andrew-yang-took-inspiration-from-mark-cuban-for-his-budget-cell-carrier-noble-mobile/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-16T10:48:19-07:00,"Former U.S. presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang is starting a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) — a company that resells wireless service using another carrier’s network infrastructure — that will give you money back on your bill if you use less data. “I’m as guilty of doomscrolling as the next person, but knowing that doomscrolling is actually costing me money makes me feel dumb,” Yang told TechCrunch. “Now my wallet and financial incentives are tied to what I want to do, which is to look up more and use my phone a little bit less.” Using T-Mobile’s network, Noble Mobile offers a $50 monthly cell phone plan with unlimited talk, text, and 5G data. If you use less than 20GB of data in a given month, you get money back in the form of “Noble Cash.” Like credit card points, these can be redeemed for rewards, or they can be cashed out for about one dollar for each GB you don’t use below the 20GB threshold. The amount of data one uses depends on their access to Wi-Fi — you don’t use up your cellular data if you’re downloading videos on your home Wi-Fi network — as well as their general habits around phone usage. (For context, as a screen-addicted millennial who constantly streams podcasts, audiobooks, and YouTube videos on the go, I’m averaging around 13GB per month, which means that I would get around $7 back from a $50 payment if I cashed out.) Noble Mobile raised a $10.3 million seed round led by Corazon Capital with participation from marketing professor Scott Galloway and other venture firms. According to Yang, the average American spends $83 per month on mobile service, which makes Noble Mobile seem suspiciously appealing (though sometimes, traditional carrier bills may appear higher because a customer is paying for their new iPhone in monthly installment payments). MVNOs like Noble Mobile or Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile, which T-Mobile acquired for $1.35 billion last year, can keep costs lower than traditional carriers because they buy wholesale access to a wireless network rather than building and operating their own infrastructure. “The business model of Verizon or AT&T in particular has gone from investing in infrastructure and network quality to keeping us frozen in place and hoping that we Americans don’t notice that we’re spending twice as much per capita on our wireless data as, for example, Europeans and Australians,” Yang said. To put this in perspective, Verizon paid $11.2 billion in cash dividends to investors last year. Knowing that MVNOs could provide cheaper service, Yang looked to Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs for inspiration. “He buys generic drugs in bulk and then resells them at a 15% markup,” Yang said of Cuban’s business, which may also add a small shipping fee or pharmacy labor fee. Cuban recently explained to TechCrunch how, even after building in that 15% markup, Cost Plus Drugs can still sell medications at lower prices than most pharmacies. His business is not beholden to pharmacy benefit managers — the companies that negotiate drug prices for insurance plans — which typically drive up costs. That independence allows him to make medications more affordable to consumers while still padding his own wallet. “I see what Mark is doing there,” Yang said. “Maybe he’s not profiteering to the same degree that some other companies are, but you can see he’s got a fine business there. And so I looked around and said, ‘Okay, what else can I ‘Cost Plus’ in American life that we all spend money on?’” By entering the MVNO market, Yang could spin up a similar business while also aligning with his stance that we should all be on our phones less. Yang has recently thrown “no-phone parties” in LA and NYC, perhaps as a way to test the waters around Noble Mobile. While Yang’s incentive to use less data may not help you while you’re watching TikToks in bed on your home Wi-Fi, it could maybe encourage you to do something else instead of opening Instagram while you’re waiting for the subway. “If you try to think about a policy approach, it’s tricky,” Yang said. He’s not wrong — Congress has been stuck for years trying to pass legislation to make the internet safer for kids. These policy solutions have proven to be subpar because they can end up creating more problems with cybersecurity and online surveillance. “If we give people money back for doing something that they want to do, which is use their phone a little bit less, maybe we can effectuate a change,” he said.

Figure reaches $39B valuation in latest funding round,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/figure-reaches-39b-valuation-in-latest-funding-round/,Maxwell Zeff,2025-09-16T09:49:44-07:00,"Posted: Humanoid robotics company Figure raised its largest round of funding yet, a sign of growing investor interest in robots designed to work alongside humans in warehouses, factories, and other settings. The company, based in San Jose, California, announced on Tuesday that it raised a Series C funding round that values it at $39 billion. The round, which “exceeded $1 billion,” said Figure, was led by Parkway Venture Capital with participation from Brookfield Asset Management, Nvidia, and Intel Capital, among others. Figure said the funding will be used to scale the company’s fleet of humanoid robots, build the necessary infrastructure to accelerate robot training, and launch advanced data collection efforts. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in funding since its 2022 founding. Earlier this year, Figure CEO Brett Adcock claimed that Figure was the most “sought-after” stock on the private market. But the company has also been sending cease-and-desist letters to multiple secondary stock market brokers, telling TechCrunch in April that it sends such letters when a broker isn’t authorized to sell its shares. TechCrunch has reached out to Figure for comment.

This $30M startup built a dog crate-sized robot factory that learns by watching humans,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/this-30m-startup-built-a-dog-crate-sized-robot-factory-that-learns-by-watching-humans/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-16T06:00:00-07:00,"While many robotics companies are building human-sized robots, or working to automate entire factories, MicroFactory is instead trying to think big by building small. San Francisco-based MicroFactory built a general-purpose, tabletop manufacturing kit that’s about the size of my Siberian husky’s dog crate. This compact factory includes two robotic arms and can be trained by human demonstration, as well as through AI. “General purpose robots are good, but it’s not necessary [to] be humanoid,” said Igor Kulakov, the co-founder and CEO of MicroFactory, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We decided to design robots from scratch that will still be general purpose but not in human shape, and this way, it can be done much simpler, much easier, in hardware and on the AI side.” Rather than selling individual robotic arms, MicroFactory’s system comes as an enclosed but transparent workstation, allowing users to watch the manufacturing process in real time. The compact factory-in-a-box is designed for precision tasks like circuit board assembly, component soldering, and cable routing. Users can train the robots by physically guiding the arms through complex motions — a hands-on approach that Kulakov says works faster than traditional AI programming for intricate manufacturing sequences. “Usually it takes couple hours, but in this way, the robot much better understands what it should do,” Kulakov said. “When you hire people, we still need to spend time, like a week or something, to instruct these people to then supervise their work. A manufacturing company, they already have this time and resources to spend, and it will be much easier to train a model and to make it work in this way.” Kulakov’s experience with traditional manufacturing helped spark the idea behind MicroFactory. He and his co-founder, Viktor Petrenko, used to run bitLighter, a manufacturing business that made portable lighting equipment for photographers. Kulakov said it was difficult to train new employees on how to complete the manufacturing process correctly. When advancements in AI made it seem possible to automate this type of work, they decided to jump on the opportunity. Kulakov and Petrenko launched MicroFactory in 2024. It took them about five months to build their prototype. Now the company has hundreds of preorders from customers looking to use the machines for various applications, including assembling electronics and even processing snails to be shipped to France for escargot. MicroFactory just raised a $1.5 million pre-seed funding round that included investors like executives from the AI company Hugging Face and investor-entrepreneur Naval Ravikant. The round values the young startup at a $30 million post-money valuation. Kulakov said the company plans to use the funding to build and ship out its units. The company is currently converting its prototype into a commercial product that it hopes to begin shipping in about two months. The company also plans to make some hires and continue improving its technology, including the AI models running under the hood. “Our growth is related to building hardware, so we set the goal to increase it 10x each year,” Kulakov said. “In the first year, we want to produce 1,000 robots, [about] three per day, and we have the capability to do this. Then, [we want to] make more and more productions.” Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Igor Kulakov, Kulakov, Petrenko, Naval Ravikant, Viktor Petrenko","TechCrunch, MicroFactory, AI","$1.5 m, $30 m",,AI
"Rodatherm Energy wants to make geothermal more efficient, but will it be cheaper?",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/rodatherm-energy-wants-to-make-geothermal-more-efficient-but-will-it-be-cheaper/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-15T14:48:02-07:00,"Rodatherm Energy , a new geothermal startup, emerged from stealth Monday with $38 million in funding and a plan to build a pilot plant in Utah. The startup differentiates itself by plumbing its boreholes with a closed loop, likely made of steel, that’s filled with a refrigerant. That contrasts with other enhanced geothermal companies, which tend to use water to transport heat from deep within the Earth. The Series A round was led by Evok Innovations with participation from Active Impact Investments, Giga Investments, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, MCJ, TDK Ventures, Tech Energy Ventures, and Toyota Ventures. Rodatherm faces stiff competition with an established field of players, including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, XGS Energy, and Quaise. Fervo is considered the frontrunner in the space, having raised nearly $1 billion. The company is on track to complete a 100-megawatt first phase of its Cape Station power plant next year with an additional 400 megawatts coming online in 2028. It also has a deal to supply Google with electricity for its data centers. XGS Energy also has a deal with Meta to develop a 150-megawatt power plant in New Mexico to power the tech company’s data centers. Rodatherm says that its closed-loop, refrigerant-based approach is 50% more efficient than a typical water-based system. Air-source heat pumps, commonly called minisplits, use hydrocarbon-based refrigerants to shift heat between indoors and out. The startup’s patent on the technology says that the closed-loop design will eliminate the need for filters to screen grit and debris that open-loop systems might suck up as the water flowing through the ground breaks bits of rock loose. It also says that the closed loop system will minimize water use. But Rodatherm’s approach will almost certainly come with increased drilling and installation costs relative to simpler systems. It’s possible that the added efficiency of its refrigerant-based design could offset those costs, though that remains an open question until the company completes a well. The company plans to use the Series A funding to complete a small pilot 1.8-megawatt pilot plant in Utah by the end of 2026. Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems plans to buy electricity from the project.

Divergent raises $290M to expand production of specialized military parts,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/divergent-raises-290m-to-expand-production-of-specialized-military-parts/,Aria Alamalhodaei,2025-09-15T13:39:23-07:00,"Posted: Amid an ongoing surge in defense tech investing, advanced manufacturing company Divergent Technologies raised $290 million, led by Rochefort Asset Management, to expand production of missile parts and other specialized components for the military. The round, which values the company at $2.3 billion, was first reported by Bloomberg . Divergent’s customers include major defense primes Lockheed Martin, RTX, and General Dynamics. The new capital, of which $40 million is debt, will help the company expand its manufacturing facilities in Los Angeles and to break ground on a new factory in Oklahoma next year. Divergent’s specialized 3D printers make up to 600 parts, and CEO and co-founder Lukas Czinger told Bloomberg that metal missile airframes are the company’s “bread and butter.” The raise underscores investor appetite for startups boosting America’s domestic manufacturing capabilities as weapons demand continues to strain traditional supply chains.

The 9 most sought-after startups from YC Demo Day,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/the-9-most-sought-after-startups-from-yc-demo-day/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-15T13:11:51-07:00,"Y Combinator hosted its Summer 2025 Demo Day last week, showcasing the latest batch of over 160 startups. As with recent batches, the majority of startups presented AI-centric solutions. However, a clear evolution was evident. Instead of  “AI-powered” products, many companies are now building AI agents or the infrastructure and tools needed to develop them. For instance, this batch had a flurry of voice AI solutions and new businesses focused on helping others monetize the “AI economy” with ads and marketing tools. We spoke with a handful of YC-focused investors to learn which startups they found most interesting and which generated the highest investment demand. Below are the most frequently mentioned. What it does: Stripe for AI startups Why it’s a fave: Many AI startups use complex pricing models that often blend a flat subscription fee per seat with usage-based charges, credits, and various add-on costs. Managing complex AI pricing on Stripe is a time-consuming, manual process. That’s why Autumn developed an open source infrastructure that simplifies Stripe integration for AI startups. The company says its technology is already used by hundreds of AI apps and 40 YC startups. Given Stripe’s dominance in payments and the explosive growth of the AI market, could a specialized billing solution for AI be the next major fintech success story? What it does: Builds Vercel for AI agents Why it’s a fave: Just as Vercel helps developers deploy and host startups, Dedalus Labs claims its platform automates the infrastructure for building AI agents, cutting hours of coding down to a few clicks. The company handles complex tasks like autoscaling and load balancing, which it says makes agent deployment fast and simple. What it does: Crowdsource rankings of vibe coded designs Why it’s a fave: The ability of AI to rapidly generate a huge number of designs creates a new problem: figuring out which ones are actually good. Design Arena solves this by crowdsourcing rankings of AI-generated visuals, creating a feedback loop that forces AI models to improve. Large AI labs see value in training their models to generate better designs, as some of them are already Design Arena’s customers. What it does: Tech-enabled distributor for retailers in Southeast Asia Why it’s a fave: GetASAP Asia was founded by Raghav Arora three years ago when he was just 14 years old. Since then, the startup that uses tech to deliver supplies to corner stores, restaurants, and large supermarkets in Southeast Asia in under eight hours, has earned millions in revenue. GetASAP Asia closed a round from General Catalyst, according to its website , and we are hearing that the startup’s valuation was among the highest in the whole batch. What it does: AI engineer that fixes bugs in production Why it’s a fave: Founded by 20-year-old Pablo Hansen who last year earned a master’s degree in AI, Keystone is on a mission to reduce software breaks. The company’s AI finds and fixes bugs for clients like Lovable and has already turned down a seven-figure acquisition offer, Hansen said. What it does: AI matchmaker for female friends Why it’s a fave: While there isn’t a shortage of dating apps, RealRoots is tackling a different kind of loneliness. The company’s AI matchmaker, Lisa, interviews women and then organizes social experiences to connect them with compatible friends. While the AI part might be performative — conversations with Lisa probably wouldn’t give RealRoots more insights about participants than written answers would — RealRoots may be on to something. Last month alone, the company generated $782,000 from 9,000 paying clients, its founders said. What it does: Automates insurance claims with AI Why it’s a fave: Solva’s AI automates the most routine tasks for insurance adjusters, from filling out complex claims to preventing improper payouts. Just 10 weeks after launching, Solva has already amassed $245,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a figure that has investors excited. What it does: Counter-drone mini-missiles Why it’s a fave: With China reportedly amassing swarms of inexpensive drones, the U.S. military faces an urgent need for cost-effective counter-drone solutions. Perseus is developing just that: small missiles designed to shoot down drones at a fraction of the cost of existing systems. Multiple branches of the U.S. military have already invited the startup to demonstrate its solution, which could lead to hefty contracts. What it does: AI foreign language tutor Why it’s a fave: Apps like Duolingo have made language learning accessible and fun, but they often lack a key component of fluency: consistent conversation. Pingo solves this problem by allowing users to speak with its AI, which acts as a native speaker. The company’s unique approach is proving incredibly popular, with founders claiming it’s growing 70% monthly and earning $250,000 in monthly revenue.

Awake’s new app requires heavy sleepers to complete tasks in order to turn off the alarm,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/awakes-new-app-requires-heavy-sleepers-to-complete-tasks-in-order-to-turn-off-the-alarm/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-15T12:00:59-07:00,"A new iOS app called Awake , designed specifically for heavy sleepers who must complete missions to turn off their alarms, launched Monday. The app is only available to users with the iOS 26 update, which also came out on Monday. Unlike traditional alarm clocks that can be silenced with a simple tap, Awake is intended to actively engage users’ brains to ensure they fully wake up. Once the alarm sounds, users must complete a series of interactive missions to turn it off. These tasks include a variety of challenges, such as rotating the iPhone, completing a set of push-ups, or tackling math problems, puzzles, or even language lessons. By incorporating physical and mental activities, Awake aims to help break the cycle of hitting snooze and encourage a more active start to the day. While other similar apps exist, such as Alarmy , Challenges , and Mathe Alarm , among others, Awake sets itself apart by offering additional features. One of these is a “Morning Briefing,” which offers a customized summary of information the user chooses the night before, including the weather forecast and events from a calendar. There’s also a Block integration, which prevents users from accessing social media immediately upon waking. A future feature will allow people to listen to new podcast episodes as soon as they open their eyes. Additionally, Awake includes a sleep planning function that helps improve sleep quality by allowing users to enter the desired amount of sleep and preferred wake-up time. It then calculates the best time to go to bed. Leo Mehlig, the indie developer behind the popular daily planner app Structured , says he developed Awake in response to high demand from Structured users. Mehlig jumped on the idea after Apple announced iOS 26, which provided developers with access to a new Alarm Kit framework to create alarm and timer apps with features like full-screen alerts. “I just felt like there had to be something better than a standard alarm clock for people who struggle to get up in the morning,” he told TechCrunch. “So we always had [planned for it], but we basically sidelined it. And then when I saw the [Apple] keynote, I saw the Alarm Kit, I was like, ‘OK, now we need to build this.’” Awake is available for free, with a premium subscription option for $6.49 per month or $19.99 per year, which unlocks additional missions such as turning on a light, scanning a QR code, and walking a certain number of steps. One mission even requires users to recite a mantra. Looking ahead, Mehlig envisions incorporating a feature called “Wake Up Check,” which will double-check if people are truly awake after completing a mission. By using the step counter, the app will track users’ movement after the mission; if no movement is detected, it will send a notification. If the user does not respond within a few minutes, the app will trigger another alarm to ensure they don’t fall back asleep. This story was updated to correct the pricing of the subscription.

Harvard Law to AI: MarqVision lands $48M to combat brand abuse,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/15/harvard-law-to-ai-marqvision-lands-48m-to-combat-brand-abuse/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-15T05:00:00-07:00,"When Mark Lee was a law student at Harvard, a trademark class exposed him to the staggering scale of counterfeiting, an illicit industry worth more than $3 trillion annually and set him on an unexpected path to entrepreneurship. “I was always broadly interested in technology and startups, but I never really thought I’d be an entrepreneur. I assumed I was set to become a lawyer; most of my family members are lawyers, and practicing law felt like a natural path,” Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. But when he got to Harvard Law, the education wasn’t quite what he expected, Lee said, adding that he began to question whether a career as a corporate lawyer was the right fit. “So I started exploring different ideas. One day, I took a trademark class and learned that counterfeiting is the world’s largest criminal enterprise, $3 trillion in counterfeit products traded every year, about 8% of global commerce. What struck me was that during COVID, as everything was moving online, this already massive market was growing 20% a year, fueled by marketplaces and social media,” Lee continued. “I saw it as a universal problem — and one that could be solved with the technology I was passionate about at the time: computer vision.” That insight became the seed for MarqVision , the company he later co-founded in 2021. The name itself reflects its origins: “Marq” from trademark, and “Vision” from computer vision. The mission was straightforward but ambitious: harness AI-powered computer vision to fight counterfeiting and trademark infringement on a global scale. Fast-forward to 2025 and the LA-headquartered AI startup has closed a $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to about $90 million. Roughly half of the fresh capital will go toward expanding its AI and engineering teams to accelerate automation and integrate generative AI across its product suite. Another $10 million is earmarked for making the platform enterprise-ready as the company moves upmarket to target larger brands, while an additional $10 million will fund regional expansion. Already active in the U.S., Korea, China, and Europe, MarqVision is now entering Japan, highlighting the borderless nature of IP law and the company’s push to scale globally. The financing was led by Peak XV Partners — formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA — with participation from Salesforce Ventures, HSG (formerly Sequoia China), Coral Capital, and Michael Seibel, partner emeritus at Y Combinator. Returning backers, including YC, Altos Ventures, and Atinum Investment, also joined the round. “Increasingly, top-tier investors are looking for technology companies that leverage AI not just to enhance productivity, but to fundamentally transform service delivery,” Lee explained. “AI is expanding the total addressable market for software from efficiency tools into the execution of the work itself — unlocking a market opportunity of over $10 trillion. While many early-stage companies are experimenting with AI to disrupt labor-intensive service industries, very few have reached the early-growth stage with the scale and traction.” MarqVision serves more than 350 customers worldwide across industries ranging from fashion and luxury to gaming, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, automotive, and consumer electronics. The startup reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossed $20 million after four years, doubling annually along the way. “Our goal is $100 million ARR by mid-2027,” Lee said. “Growth could have been faster, but we prioritized two things: delivering the best customer experience and building a scalable AI-driven foundation. As a managed service, we can monetize many offerings, but everything ties back to one core promise — helping global brands control their digital presence and grow revenue.” Once considered an unappealing category in technology, “services” is being redefined by AI, which brings software-like scalability and efficiency. This shift has fueled investor interest, with Peak XV, HSG, and Salesforce Ventures backing the company’s vision. The rise of large language models has reframed its positioning from a “software company with humans in the loop” to a leader in the emerging AI-led services space, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round. MarqVision started out fighting counterfeits, using AI to spot and remove fake products online. As the technology advanced, the startup shifted its focus toward helping brands directly recover lost revenue. Today, many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales, making the platform valuable not just to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations tracking revenue impact, according to Lee. When Lee first pitched MarqVision, he envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling $50,000 tools to 10,000 IP teams worldwide. But YC partner Michael Seibel urged him to think bigger — beyond software — by reimagining how IP and brand professionals work. MarqVision has since expanded into end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100x larger than his original plan. Brand protection typically involves detecting and removing infringements like counterfeits and impersonations, while brand control goes further, giving companies the ability to manage their presence across e-commerce, social media, websites, and chat platforms, Lee noted.

Pilot union urges FAA to reject Rainmaker’s drone cloud-seeding plan,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/13/pilot-union-urges-faa-to-reject-rainmakers-drone-cloud-seeding-plan/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-13T12:10:43-07:00,"Rainmaker Technology’s bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup’s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines. The FAA’s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker’s bet on small drones hangs in the balance. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker’s petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.” However, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union’s objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company’s safety data and risk mitigations. Rainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety. In its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble. Rainmaker’s petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn’t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. The union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents. “Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration’s EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said. Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot’s union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.” “Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added. Doricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op. “Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA’s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said. “Regarding ALPA’s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said. However, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.” Cloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt. The general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals. When a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation. Rainmaker’s twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place. What happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it’s decided, the agency’s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches. 9/13/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker’s comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager .

These emails reportedly announce an immediate “strategic pivot,” with the company deciding to “accelerate the expansion and prioritization of our specialist AI tutors, while scaling back our focus on general AI tutor roles.” “As part of this shift in focus, we no longer need most generalist AI tutor positions and your employment with xAI will conclude,” xAI reportedly wrote. According to Business Insider, these cuts represent about one-third of xAI’s 1,500-person data-annotation team — the team that works to label and prepare data used to train xAI’s chatbot Grok. When contacted for confirmation, xAI pointed to a statement on X (the Mu***REMOVED*** social network that xAI acquired earlier this year ) declaring that the company “will immediately surge our Specialist AI tutor team by 10x.” “We are hiring across domains like STEM, finance, medicine, safety, and many more,” the company said.

"Hike, once a unicorn, shuts down as India cracks down on real-money gaming",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/13/hike-once-a-unicorn-shuts-down-as-india-cracks-down-on-real-money-gaming/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-13T07:05:49-07:00,"Hike, once one of India’s most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi’s recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down. On Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup’s U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.” Initially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Rush attracted over 10 million users and generated more than $500 million in gross revenue over its four-year run, Mittal said. Storied investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent, backed Hike’s early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. The startup was valued at $1.4 billion in 2016. “We could raise the capital, but the real question is: Is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for?” Mittal wrote in a Substack post. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.” Last month, the Indian government shocked the $23-billion real-money gaming industry by introducing the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, which imposed a blanket ban on such platforms. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games. In response, top industry players, including Dream Sports and Mobile Premier League (MPL), began shutting down their real-money gaming operations in India. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services , others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive. The crackdown has also triggered a wave of layoffs, with around 2,000 job losses reported across companies like Games24x7 , Head Digital Works , MPL , and Zupee . Some of them are planning to cut up to 90% of their workforce as they attempt to adapt or exit the space, sources told TechCrunch. Some VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch. Earlier this week, the Indian Supreme Court transferred all petitions challenging the new law — the rules of which are yet to be notified — from multiple state courts across the country. However, the top court has yet to begin hearing the matter. “This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.

It isn’t your imagination: Google Cloud is flooding the zone,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/it-isnt-your-imagination-google-cloud-is-flooding-the-zone/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T21:41:36-07:00,"The $100 billion partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI, announced Monday, represents — for now — the latest mega-deal reshaping the AI infrastructure landscape. The agreement involves nonvoting shares tied to massive chip purchases and enough computing power for more than 5 million U.S. households, deepening the relationship between two of AI’s most powerful players. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is placing a different bet entirely. While the industry’s biggest players cement ever-tighter partnerships, Google Cloud is hell-bent on capturing the next generation of AI companies before they become too big to court. Francis deSouza, its COO, has seen the AI revolution from multiple vantage points. As the former CEO of genomics giant Illumina, he watched machine learning transform drug discovery. As co-founder of a two-year-old AI alignment startup, Synth Labs, he has grappled with the safety challenges of increasingly powerful models. Now, having joined the C-suite at Google Cloud in January, he’s orchestrating a massive wager on AI’s second wave. It’s a story deSouza likes to tell in numbers. In a conversation with this editor , he notes several times that nine out of the top 10 AI labs use Google’s infrastructure. He also says that nearly all generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud, that 60% of all GenAI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider, and that the company has lined up $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, which represents more than double its current annual run rate. Asked what percentage of Google Cloud’s revenue comes from AI companies, he offers instead that “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups.” The Nvidia-OpenAI deal exemplifies the scale of consolidation sweeping AI infrastructure. Microsoft’s original $1 billion OpenAI investment has grown to nearly $14 billion. Amazon followed with $8 billion in Anthropic investments, securing deep hardware customizations that essentially tailor AI training to work better with Amazon’s infrastructure. Oracle has emerged as a surprise winner, too, landing a $30 billion cloud deal with OpenAI and then securing a jaw-dropping $300 billion five-year commitment starting in 2027. Even Meta, despite building its own infrastructure, signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud while planning $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure spending through 2028. The Trump administration’s $500 billion “Stargate” project, involving SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships. These gigantic deals might seem threatening for Google, given the partnerships that companies like OpenAI and Nvidia appear to be cementing elsewhere. In fact, it looks a lot like Google is being cut out of some frenzied dealmaking. But the corporate behemoth isn’t exactly sitting on its hands. Instead, Google Cloud is signing smaller companies like Lovable and Windsurf — what deSouza calls the “next generation of companies coming up,” without major up-front investments. The strategy extends beyond simple customer acquisition. Google offers AI startups $350,000 in cloud credits, access to its technical teams, and go-to-market support through its marketplace. Google Cloud also provides what deSouza describes as a “no compromise” AI stack — from chips to models to applications — with an “open ethos” that gives customers choice at every layer. The approach reflects both opportunity and necessity. In a market where companies can go “from being a startup to being a multibillion-dollar company in a very short period of time,” as deSouza puts it, capturing future unicorns before they mature could prove more valuable than fighting over today’s giants. “Companies love the fact that they can get access to our AI stack, they can get access to our teams to understand where our technologies are going,” deSouza says during our interview. “They also love that they’re getting access to enterprise-grade Google class infrastructure.” Google’s infrastructure play got even more ambitious recently, with reporting revealing the company’s behind-the-scenes maneuvering to expand its custom AI chip business. According to The Information , Google has struck deals to place its tensor processing units (TPUs) in other cloud providers’ data centers for the first time, including an agreement with London-based Fluidstack that includes up to $3.2 billion in financial backing for a New York facility. Competing directly with AI companies while simultaneously providing them infrastructure requires … finesse. Google Cloud provides TPU chips to OpenAI and hosts Anthropic’s Claude model through its Vertex AI platform, even as its own Gemini models compete head-to-head with both. (Google Cloud’s parent company, Alphabet, also owns a 14% stake in Anthropic, per New York Times court documents obtained earlier this year, though when asked directly about Google’s financial relationship with Anthropic, deSouza calls the relationship a “multi-layered partnership,” then quickly redirects me to Google Cloud’s model marketplace, noting that customers can access various foundation models.) But if Google is trying to be Switzerland while advancing its own agenda, it has had plenty of practice. The approach has roots in Google’s open source contributions, from Kubernetes to the foundational “ Attention Is All You Need ” paper that enabled the transformer architecture underlying most modern AI. More recently, Google published an open source protocol called Agent2Agent (A2A) for interagent communication in an attempt to demonstrate its continued commitment to openness even in competitive areas. “We have made the explicit choice over the years to be open at every layer of the stack, and we know that this means companies can absolutely take our technology and use it to build a competitor at the next layer,” deSouza acknowledges. “That’s been happening for decades. That’s something we are okay with.” Google Cloud’s courtship of startups comes at a particularly interesting moment. Just this month, federal judge Amit Mehta delivered a nuanced ruling in the government’s five-year-old search monopoly case, attempting to curb Google’s dominance without hampering its AI ambitions. While Google avoided the Justice Department’s most severe proposed penalties, including the forced divestment of its Chrome browser, the ruling underscored regulatory concerns about the company leveraging its search monopoly to dominate AI. Critics are worried, understandably, that Google’s vast trove of search data provides an unfair advantage in developing AI systems and that the company could deploy the same monopolistic tactics that secured its search dominance. In conversation, deSouza is focused on far more positive outcomes. “I think we have an opportunity to fundamentally understand some of the major diseases that today we just don’t have a good understanding of,” deSouza says, for example, outlining a vision where Google Cloud helps power research into Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and climate technologies. “We want to work very hard to make sure that we are pioneering the technologies that will enable that work.” Critics may not easily be assuaged. By positioning itself as an open platform that empowers rather than controls the next generation of AI companies, Google Cloud may be showing regulators that it fosters competition rather than stifles it, all while forging relationships with startups that might help Google’s case if regulators ramp up pressure. For our full chat with deSouza, check out this week’s StrictlyVC Download podcast; a new episode comes out every Tuesday. Also, note a correction made as of 9/26: We misquoted deSouza as calling Google Cloud the “primary” computing partner of startups Windsurf and Lovable; we apologize for the oversight.

"Neon, the No. 2 social app on the Apple App Store, pays users to record their phone calls and sells data to AI firms",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-24T12:50:58-07:00,"A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple’s U.S. App Store’s Social Networking section. The app, Neon Mobile , pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations. Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures . On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps. Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app. According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user. That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.” The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society. Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a: …worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed. That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims. The terms also include an extensive section on beta features, which have no warranty and may have all sorts of issues and bugs. Though Neon’s app raises many red flags, it may be technically legal. “Recording only one side of the phone call is aimed at avoiding wiretap laws,” Jennifer Daniels, a partner with the law firm Blank Rome ‘s Privacy, Security & Data Protection Group, tells TechCrunch. “Under [the] laws of many states, you have to have consent from both parties to a conversation in order to record it … It’s an interesting approach,” says Daniels. Peter Jackson, cybersecurity and privacy attorney at Greenberg Glusker, agreed — and tells TechCrunch that the language around “one-sided transcripts” sounds like it could be a backdoor way of saying that Neon records users’ calls in their entirety but may just remove what the other party said from the final transcript. In addition, the legal experts pointed to concerns about how anonymized the data may really be. Neon claims it removes users’ names, emails, and phone numbers before selling data to AI companies. But the company doesn’t say how AI partners or others it sells to could use that data. Voice data could be used to make fake calls that sound like they’re coming from you, or AI companies could use your voice to make their own AI voices. “Once your voice is over there, it can be used for fraud,” says Jackson. “Now this company has your phone number and essentially enough information — they have recordings of your voice, which could be used to create an impersonation of you and do all sorts of fraud.” Even if the company itself is trustworthy, Neon doesn’t disclose who its trusted partners are or what those entities are allowed to do with users’ data further down the road. Neon is also subject to potential data breaches, as any company with valuable data may be. In a brief test by TechCrunch, Neon did not offer any indication that it was recording the user’s call, nor did it warn the call recipient. The app worked like any other voice-over-IP app, and the caller ID displayed the inbound phone number, as usual. (We’ll leave it to security researchers to attempt to verify the app’s other claims.) Neon founder Alex Kiam didn’t return a request for comment. Kiam, who is identified only as “Alex” on the company website, operates Neon from a New York apartment, a business filing shows. A LinkedIn post indicates Kiam raised money from Upfront Ventures a few months ago for his startup, but the investor didn’t respond to an inquiry from TechCrunch as of the time of writing. There was a time when companies looking to profit from data collection through mobile apps handled this type of thing on the sly. When it was revealed in 2019 that Facebook was paying teens to install an app that spies on them , it was a scandal. The following year, headlines buzzed again when it was discovered that app store analytics providers operated dozens of seemingly innocuous apps to collect usage data about the mobile app ecosystem. There are regular warnings to be wary of VPN apps , which often aren’t as private as they claim. There are even government reports detailing how agencies regularly purchase personal data that’s “commercially available” on the market. Now AI agents regularly join meetings to take notes, and always-on AI devices are on the market. But at least in those cases, everyone is consenting to a recording, Daniels tells TechCrunch. In light of this widespread usage and sale of personal data, there are likely now those cynical enough to think that if their data is being sold anyway, they may as well profit from it. Unfortunately, they may be sharing more information than they realize and putting others’ privacy at risk when they do. “There is a tremendous desire on the part of, certainly, knowledge workers — and frankly, everybody — to make it as easy as possible to do your job,” says Jackson. “And some of these productivity tools do that at the expense of, obviously, your privacy, but also, increasingly, the privacy of those with whom you are interacting on a day-to-day basis.”  Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.","Kiam, Jackson, Daniels, mobile apps, Jennifer Daniels, Alex Kiam, Peter Jackson, Neon, App Store, Recordings","Security & Data Protection Group, TechCrunch, Apple, AI, Daniels, iPhone, Upfront Ventures, Greenberg Glusker, Neon, Blank Rome ‘s, Neon Mobile, LinkedIn, Social Networking",$30 ,,AI
"Trump hits H-1B visas with $100,000 fee, targeting the program that launched Elon Musk and Instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/trump-hits-h-1b-visas-with-100000-fee-targeting-the-program-that-launched-elon-mu***REMOVED***/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T12:13:20-07:00,"President Trump just made it a lot more expensive for companies to hire foreign workers through the H-1B program. The White House announced Friday that Trump signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a hefty $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, an enormous jump from the current $215 lottery registration fee. H-1B visas allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in fields that typically require technical expertise like IT, engineering, mathematics, or medicine. The program is capped at 65,000 new visas annually, plus an additional 20,000 for foreign graduates with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. The visas are awarded through a lottery system and typically last three years, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. The administration’s new move is designed to crack down on what it calls widespread abuse of the program, which it blames for displacing American workers. According to the White House, the share of IT workers with H-1B visas has skyrocketed from 32% in 2003 to over 65% today, while unemployment among recent computer science graduates has hit 6.1%. Silicon Valley will undoubtedly be up in arms over the initiative. The restrictions take aim at a program that helped create some of the region’s biggest success stories. Elon Musk, Trump’s close ally for most of this year, initially worked in the U.S. on an H-1B after arriving as a student. In fact, Musk, taking issue with a perceived critic of the H-1B program in December on his platform X, tweeted to the individual that, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B. Take a big step back and F*** YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder-turned-chief-product-officer at AI giant Anthropic, is one of those aforementioned success stories. The Brazilian-born Stanford grad worked at the early instant messaging platform Meebo on an H-1B visa. Earlier this year, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) argued in a letter to the National Science Foundation: “Raising the annual cap of H-1B visas issued each year to educated and highly skilled immigrants who work in jobs that require a substantial amount of technical and specialized training is fundamental to generating more successful immigrant-founded companies.” The NVCA noted that while “H-1B visas are not ideal for immigrants who want to immediately found companies in the U.S., they are still critically important for the success of immigrant founded companies because they provide valuable work experience and widen the pipeline of potential immigrant startup founders.” (The H-1B’s employer-employee requirement makes it practically impossible for founders to obtain directly, forcing them to spend years tied to employers before getting green cards that let them launch their own startups. When Krieger wanted to co-found Instagram in 2010, transferring his visa took months, and he has said he almost abandoned the startup before it launched due to those complications.) On Friday, tech leaders on X were already warning about talent fleeing to more welcoming countries. And Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have reportedly told employees with H-1B visas to avoid foreign travel and remain in the United states for now . In the meantime, in its proclamation on Friday, the Trump administration went full bore on its criticism of the program, pointing to specific companies that approved thousands of H-1B workers while simultaneously laying off American employees. According to the White House fact sheet, one unnamed company received approval for 5,189 H-1B workers this fiscal year while cutting roughly 16,000 U.S. jobs. The proclamation —  which says it is partly rooted in an effort to “protect our national security” —  includes wiggle room; case-by-case exemptions are possible if deemed in the national interest. It also directs the labor secretary to revise wage requirements to prevent undercutting American salaries. This post has been updated to include reports on how Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are responding.

"Updates to Studio, YouTube Live, new GenAI tools, and everything else announced at Made on YouTube",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/20/updates-to-studio-youtube-live-new-gen-ai-tools-and-everything-else-announced-at-made-on-youtube/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-20T08:00:00-07:00,"At its annual Made on YouTube event this week, YouTube unveiled tons of new updates, features, and tools geared toward creators, including updates to YouTube Live, new ways to monetize, and more. Studio updates include “likeness” detection and lip-synced dubs, and the company is offering new AI tools for podcasters to help promote their shows. Here’s everything announced at Made on YouTube. The company showed off new and updated tools to Studio , which creators use to manage their channels and track analytics. Updates include an inspiration tab, title A/B testing features, auto dubbing, and more. What caught our attention is the “likeness”-detection feature, which was announced last year and made available to a few creators; it’s now in open beta. People will be able to detect, manage, and flag for removal any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness. An AI-powered Ask Studio can guide users and answer questions about their account, and creators will be able to collaborate with up to five other people on one video, which is available to the audiences of all the participating video makers. YouTube gave Live, its livestreaming platform , some updates as well, like letting creators play minigames to entertain viewers, broadcasting simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical formats, providing AI-powered highlights, reacting to live events, using a new ad format, and more. The AI-powered highlights automatically select the best moments from a livestream to turn them into shareable Shorts, and a new ad format — called “side-by-side” — runs adjacent to the main content, similar to a split-screen display, rather than interrupting the stream. YouTube is bringing a custom version of Veo 3 , Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, to Shorts, as well as a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and more. With Veo 3 Fast, as the custom version is called, creators can apply motion from a video to an image, add different styles to their videos, and insert objects into the video with a simple text prompt. Creators can also transform the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for other Shorts using Google’s AI music model, Lyria 2. YouTube Music got some updates as well , designed to deepen engagement between creators and their fans. These include a countdown timer for new releases and a chance to offer fans “thank you” videos, and the company is testing a pilot program for U.S. listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists. Video podcast creators in the U.S. will be able to create clips more easily with AI suggestions , according to YouTube. And a new feature rolling out next year will offer a way to turn audio podcasts into video podcasts YouTube is giving creators new ways to monetize , with brand deals and through the YouTube Shopping program, which lets creators earn money by featuring and tagging products in their content. YouTube will also now allow creators to swap out brand sponsorships in long-form videos. In addition, creators can take advantage of auto timestamps for product tags, auto tagging for eligible items mentioned in videos, and a new brand link feature for Shorts. An AI-powered system will help identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time. Shorts creators will soon be able to add a link to a brand’s site specifically for brand deals, and YouTube will proactively suggest creators who may be a good fit for brands in its creator partnerships hub.

"Google isn’t kidding around about cost cutting, even slashing its FT subscription",https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/google-isnt-kidding-around-about-cost-cutting-even-slashing-its-ft-subscription/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T22:25:49-07:00,"Google is ending its enterprise subscription to the Financial Times, and it’s not the only enterprise media subscription on the chopping block, sources say. The cuts reflect broader cost-reduction efforts at the search giant, even as the company reports strong financial performance. Google has been implementing cost reductions across 2025, including eliminating 35% of managers who oversee teams of three people or fewer, and offering voluntary exit programs across multiple divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi signaled late last year that the company would continue to push cost cuts “a little further,” a mandate that appears unchanged despite Alphabet reporting strong Q2 2025 results with $96.4 billion in revenue. These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers. August data from the trade association Digital Content Next showed median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers fell 10% between May and June of this year, with non-news brands experiencing 14% drops. Major outlets, including CNN, Business Insider, and HuffPost have reportedly seen even sharper traffic declines (of 30%, 40%, and 40% , respectively), according to data from SimilarWeb. Publishers attribute these declines largely to Google’s AI Overviews feature, which has reduced click-throughs to external websites from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to Pew Research. This spring, Pew analyzed data from 900 U.S. adults, six in 10 of whom conducted at least one Google search in March 2025 that produced an AI-generated summary. A Google spokesperson responded to this story after publication, stating: “The claim that this is due to a change in our commitment to news partnerships is patently false. Our partnerships regularly evolve, and we have partnerships in place with more than 2800 publications worldwide and we’ve made billions of dollars in payments directly to publishers, platforms and content providers.” The traffic decline comes as Google has largely resisted content licensing, unlike rival OpenAI, which has signed deals with numerous major publishers, including The Financial Times , News Corp , and Axel Springer. So far at least, Google has struck few deals, including one with the Associated Press and an annual Reddit agreement reportedly worth $60 million per year. (According to a new Bloomberg report , Reddit is now looking to renegotiate its contracts with both Google and OpenAI, with Bloomberg suggesting that Reddit sees its prominent role in search results and generative AI training as even more valuable than it first understood.) Google reportedly began exploratory talks with 20 outlets about more content licensing deals this summer. Still, some might see Google canceling its FT subscription as akin to a plagiarist refusing to buy the textbook they’re copying from. At a Fortune event earlier this month, the CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. — Neil Vogel of People Inc. — didn’t hold his punches, calling Google a “ bad actor ” and accusing it of using the same bot to crawl websites for its search engine as it does to support its AI features. While Google’s approach to AI training has differed from other AI players, the company does offer publishers ways to opt out of having their data used without affecting search access. “For a long time,” Vogel said at the event, “the deal was: ‘Take our content, build your search engine, send us back traffic’. That deal’s off.” In a separate, scathing op-ed this summer, Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint wrote that Google’s AI overviews are creating a “zero-click” environment where “ all traffic dead ends at Google .” Editor’s note: This story has been updated post-publication to include a statement from Google and to correct an inaccurate characterization of Google’s AI training policies. The original story incorrectly stated that publishers cannot block Google’s AI systems without also forfeiting search traffic. Google offers an opt-out option that allows publishers to block AI training while maintaining search access.

Meta CTO explains why the smart glasses demos failed at Meta Connect — and it wasn’t the Wi-Fi,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/19/meta-cto-explains-why-the-smart-glasses-demos-failed-at-meta-connect-and-it-wasnt-the-wi-fi/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-19T09:04:11-07:00,"Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth took to his Instagram to explain, in more technical detail, why multiple demos of Meta’s new smart glasses technology failed at Meta Connect, the company’s developer conference, this week. Meta on Wednesday introduced three new pairs of smart glasses, including an upgraded version of its existing Ray-Ban Meta, a new Meta Ray-Ban Display that comes with a wristband controller, and the sports-focused Oakley Meta Vanguard . However, at different points during the event, the live technology demos failed to work. In one, cooking content creator Jack Mancuso asked his Ray-Ban Meta glasses how to get started with a particular sauce recipe. After repeating the question, “What do I do first?” with no response, the AI skipped ahead in the recipe, forcing him to stop the demo. He then tossed it back to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that he thinks the Wi-Fi may be messed up. In another demo, the glasses failed to pick up a live WhatsApp video call between Bosworth and Zuckerberg; Zuckerberg eventually had to give up. Bosworth walked onstage, joking about the “brutal” Wi-Fi. “You practice these things like a hundred times, and then you never know what’s gonna happen,” Zuckerberg said at the time. After the event, Bosworth took to his Instagram for a Q&A session about the new tech and the live demo failures. On the latter, he explained that it wasn’t actually the Wi-Fi that caused the issue with the chef’s glasses. Instead, it was a mistake in resource management planning. “When the chef said, ‘Hey, Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Ray-Ban Meta’s Live AI in the building. And there were a lot of people in that building,” Bosworth explained. “That obviously didn’t happen in rehearsal; we didn’t have as many things,” he said, referring to the number of glasses that were triggered. That alone wasn’t enough to cause the disruption, though. The second part of the failure had to do with how Meta had chosen to route the Live AI traffic to its development server to isolate it during the demo. But when it did so, it did this for everyone in the building on the access points, which included all the headsets. “So we DDoS’d ourselves, basically, with that demo,” Bosworth added. (A DDoS attack, or a distributed denial of service attack, is one where a flood of traffic overwhelms a server or service, slowing it down or making it unavailable. In this case, Meta’s dev server wasn’t set up to handle the flood of traffic from the other glasses in the building — Meta was only planning for it to handle the demos alone.) The issue with the failed WhatsApp call, on the other hand, was the result of a new bug. The smart glasses’ display had gone to sleep at the exact moment the call came in, Bosworth said. When Zuckerberg woke the display back up, it didn’t show the answer notification to him. The CTO said this was a “race condition” bug, or where the outcome depends on the unpredictable and uncoordinated timing of two or more different processes trying to use the same resource simultaneously. “We’ve never run into that bug before,” Bosworth noted. “That’s the first time we’d ever seen it. It’s fixed now, and that’s a terrible, terrible place for that bug to show up.” He stressed that, of course, Meta knows how to handle video calls, and the company was “bummed” about the bug showing up here. Despite the issues, Bosworth said he’s not worried about the results of the glitches. “Obviously, I don’t love it, but I know the product works. I know it has the goods. So it really was just a demo fail and not, like, a product failure,” he said.

How AI startups are fueling Google’s booming cloud business,https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/,Connie Loizos,2025-09-18T13:53:33-07:00,"Google Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers. Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as one of their cloud computing providers, the latest sign of Google’s rising prominence against larger rivals like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud tells TechCrunch that it handles a significant percentage of Lovable and Windsurf’s cloud and AI workloads today, though the startups are not contractually obligated to primarily work with Google. The deals also highlight Google’s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company’s future. Today, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google’s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum. Google Cloud is one of the company’s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023. Winning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud’s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI , and 60% of the world’s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it’s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud. While Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition , spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment. Google says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition’s AI agent, Devin. In an interview with TechCrunch, Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said the startup works with a variety of cloud providers, including Google Cloud, but it’s hard to say which company it uses the most. Lovable declined to comment. The significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it’s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research. The company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder’s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named. Part of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program. Update 9/19/25: This article has been updated to clarify language around the term “primary cloud computing provider” and include comment from Windsurf’s CEO. Neither Lovable nor Windsurf have signed a preferred cloud provider agreement, a contractual designation that guarantees a startup does a majority of their work with a single cloud provider.
