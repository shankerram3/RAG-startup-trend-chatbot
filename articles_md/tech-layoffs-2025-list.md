## September
### Just Eat
Will [eliminate around 450 jobs](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/just-eat-lay-off-around-450-employees-partly-automating-operations-2025-09-25/) as part of a cost and operations review, according to Reuters. The layoffs will span multiple functions and countries, including customer service and sales. Europe’s largest food delivery company said it is increasingly using automation and AI, shifting many manual service tasks to automated systems.
### **Fiverr**
[Plans to cut around 250 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/business/fiverr-to-cut-about-250-jobs-in-refocusing-effort-reiterates-guidance-8f15ee4b), approximately 30% of its workforce, as part of a push to become a leaner, faster, and AI-focused company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Tel Aviv-headquartered freelance services marketplace said the restructuring will reduce management layers and position it to pursue growth with an AI-native approach.
### ZipRecruiter
Is closing [its Tel Aviv development center, cutting about 80 jobs](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/pwjukv20s). Led by Yosi Taguri, the office specialized in software, data, and AI research, including algorithm development. The California-based recruitment firm, founded in 2010, is trimming costs amid a challenging labor market.
### GupShup
Has [laid off at least 100 employees](https://inc42.com/buzz/exclusive-gupshup-lays-off-100-employees-in-cost-cutting-exercise/), including junior developers, just months after cutting nearly 200 jobs. The San Francisco-based conversational AI company, which is preparing for an IPO within two years, [raised $60 million in equity and debt in July](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/gupshup-raises-60m-in-equity-and-debt-leaves-unicorn-status-hanging/).
### xAI
Laid off about a third of its data annotation team, [cutting roughly 500 jobs](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-mu***REMOVED***), according to Business Insider. The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports.
### Rivian 
Has [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/rivian-layoffs-ev-manufacturer-1f20bc7f) laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model.
### Oracle
Is cutting another [101 jobs in Seattle](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/cloud-computing-giant-oracle-lays-off-more-seattle-workers/) and 254 [in San Francisco](https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/oracle-bay-area-layoffs/), just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment.
### Salesforce
Is trimming another [262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/salesforce-laying-off-262-employees-in-san-francisco-after-ceo-praises-ai/), according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles and follows [a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue](https://www.geekwire.com/2025/salesforce-lays-off-93-employees-in-washington-state-as-benioff-touts-ai-driven-efficiencies/) earlier this month.
## August 
### Cisco
Will [eliminate 221 positions](https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/cisco-oracle-layoffs-bay-area-20824135.php) across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy.
### Restaurant365
[Laid off about 100 employees last month](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/tech-supplier-restaurant365-lays-9-staff), around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets. The cuts affected staff across all departments. The company provides back-office software for restaurant chains.
### Oracle
Is [set to cut 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location](https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/cisco-and-oracle-to-cut-hundreds-of-bay-area-jobs/), with notices issued on August 13 and terminations effective October 13. The company, which recently disclosed [nearly 200 layoffs](https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/oracle-lay-offs-bay-area/) at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to [lay off 161 employees in Seattle](https://esd.wa.gov/employer-requirements/layoffs-and-employee-notifications/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-notification-warn-layoff-and-closure-database), according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department.
### F5
Is [cutting 106 positions](https://esd.wa.gov/employer-requirements/layoffs-and-employee-notifications/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-notification-warn-layoff-and-closure-database) at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected.
### Peloton
[Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff](https://www.theverge.com/news/754154/peloton-q4-2025-earnings-layoffs-wellness-price) in just over a year. Peloton CEO Peter Stern said the cuts are needed to improve long-term business health.
### Kaltura
Is cutting [10% of its workforce](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/6a8duhohw), or about 70 employees, as part of a cost-saving effort to reduce operating expenses by $8.5 million, marking its third round of layoffs since 2022. The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings.
### Yotpo
Is [laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1cc5uk00xx#google_vignette), as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations. The Israeli-founded unicorn is partnering with Attentive and Omnisend to continue supporting marketing services while investing in AI-powered tools like automated review summaries, smart sorting, and a new Loyalty Tiers system.
### Windsurf
Laid off 30 employees and is now [offering buyouts to the remaining 200](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/three-weeks-after-acquiring-windsurf-cognition-offers-staff-the-exit-door/). The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in. Despite initial promises to value Windsurf’s team, the deal now looks more focused on the startup’s intellectual property than its people.
### Wondery
Is [cutting 100 jobs](https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/amazon-reorganizes-audio-wondery-audible-jen-sargent-exit-1236477796/), and its CEO, Jen Sargent, is departing.

## July 
### Atlassian

The decision came via a prerecorded message from CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, just hours before co-founder Scott Farquhar urged Australia to embrace an “AI revolution” and move beyond “jobs of the past” in an Australian Press Club address. The Australian software firm was founded 2002.
### Consensys
Is [cutting about 7% of its workforce](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-22/crypto-software-firm-consensys-eliminates-about-7-of-workforce), or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports. The decision follows the recent acquisition of a startup with around 30 staff, who will stay on with the company. Despite the cuts, the blockchain software company that operates the popular digital wallet MetaMask says it will continue hiring for select roles.
### Zeen
Is [shutting down operations](https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-creator-economy-collage-startup-zeen-shutting-down-2025-7), per a report by Business Insider. The social collaging platform aimed at creators was founded in 2019 and raised $9 million in funding. Its closure highlights the persistent challenges social media startups face in building user bases and achieving long-term growth.
### Scale AI
Is [laying off around 200 employees](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/scale-ai-lays-off-14-of-staff-largely-in-data-labeling-business/) — roughly 14% of its workforce — and severing ties with 500 global contractors. The cuts come just weeks after Meta brought in the data-labeling startup’s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal.
### Lenovo
Plans to cut [more than 100 U.S. full-time jobs](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article310699130.html), about 3% of its workforce, including positions at its Morrisville, North Carolina, campus. As of February 2024, the PC maker employed around 5,100 workers in the U.S.

Last week, Intel announced that it will lay off more than 500 employees in Oregon, which is about 20% of its workforce, per [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-08/intel-cuts-more-than-500-jobs-in-oregon-as-part-of-layoff-plan). 
### Indeed + Glassdoor
Plan to [eliminate approximately 1,300 jobs combined](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/indeed-glassdoor-to-lay-off-1300-staff/) as part of a larger restructuring effort to combine their operations and focus on AI. The layoff will mostly affect employees in the U.S., particularly in the R&D, HR, and sustainability teams, [according to an internal memo by Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/11/indeed-glassdoor-to-lay-off-1300-staff/), the CEO of Recruit Holdings, which is the Japanese parent company of Indeed and Glassdoor.

Eigen Labs [said it had raised $70 million in tokens](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/06/17/eigen-labs-raises-70-million-from-a16z-for-ethereum-restaking/) from a16z Crypto in June.

[The reduction follows](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-will-lay-off-9000-employees-or-less-than-4-of-the-company/) a series of layoffs earlier this year: It cut less than 1% of the headcount in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June.
