# Should AI do everything? OpenAI thinks so

Silicon Valley’s rule? It’s not cool to be cautious. As OpenAI removes guardrails and VCs criticize companies like Anthropic for supporting AI safety regulations, it’s becoming clearer who the industry thinks should shape AI development. 
On this episode of [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/), Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Max Zeff discuss how the line between innovation and responsibility [is getting blurrier](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users/), plus what happens when pranks go from digital to physical. 
Watch to the full episode for more about: 
  * The [real-world DDoS attack](https://x.com/rtwlz/status/1977443969115029847) that blocked Waymo service for a day near a dead-end San Francisco street 


  * [Goldman Sachs acquiring Industry Ventures](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/goldman-sachs-is-acquiring-industry-ventures-for-up-to-965m-as-alternative-vc-exits-surge/) for up to $965 million, signaling Wall Street’s growing interest in the secondary venture market 


  * [FleetWorks’ $17 million Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/fleetworks-raises-17m-to-match-truckers-with-cargo-faster/) to modernize trucking with AI 


  * Why advocating for AI safety has become “uncool” in Silicon Valley from Anthropic facing backlash to [California’s SB 243](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/13/california-becomes-first-state-to-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots/) regulation of AI companion chatbots and the success of companies like Character.AI 


  * [Which startups](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/navan-plows-ahead-with-ipo-during-shutdown-aims-for-6-45b-valuation/) are using an SEC workaround to file for IPOs during the shutdown
