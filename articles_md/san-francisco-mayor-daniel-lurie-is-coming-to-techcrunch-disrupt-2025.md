San Francisco is getting a symbolic jolt very soon as newly elected mayor Daniel Lurie steps onto the **[Disrupt Stage](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/agenda/?promo=post_mayordaniellurie_10252025&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc)** at **[TechCrunch Disrupt 2025](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&promo=post_mayordaniellurie_10252025&display=)** , taking place October 27-29 at Moscone West, in a homecoming of sorts for both tech and the city that helped define it.
Disrupt has long been a launchpad for founders and investors chasing the next wave. Lurie’s visit signals a renewed effort to weave innovation back into San Francisco’s future. **[Register now](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=post_mayordaniellurie_10252025&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc)** to save up to $444 on your pass, and get 60% off a plus-one ticket.
[![TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Mayor Daniel Lurie](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TC25_Mayor-Daniel-Lurie-Speaker-16x9-Dark.png?w=680)](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=post_mayordaniellurie_10252025&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc)
## City Hall meets the startup community at Disrupt
[Daniel Lurie](https://x.com/DanielLurie), who campaigned on revitalizing the city’s economy and restoring its global standing, isn’t just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about tech’s impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.
By showing up at Disrupt 2025, Lurie is making a statement: San Francisco isn’t retreating from its role as a capital of innovation. It’s doubling down.
For TechCrunch, hosting the mayor isn’t mere pageantry. It marks an important moment as Disrupt continues to be one of the few gatherings where 10,000+ builders at all stages, heavyweight VCs, and now civic leadership converge under one roof. If Lurie wants a blueprint for the city’s rebound, he’ll find it in these halls: scrappy founders, hungry investors, and the enduring belief that San Francisco’s best inventions haven’t been built yet.
## Just 7 days left to save on your pass and catch Mayor Lurie live
If you care about San Francisco and its place at the center of the startup universe, you won’t want to miss this sit-down with Lurie. Bring a partner, friend, or team member and save 60% on their plus-one ticket. Or save up to $444 on your own pass, or up to 30% with a group. Disrupt doors open in exactly seven days at Moscone West. **[Register now](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/tickets/?promo=post_mayordaniellurie_10252025&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=speaker&utm_medium=post&utm_source=tc)** and don’t miss the tech epicenter of the year.
