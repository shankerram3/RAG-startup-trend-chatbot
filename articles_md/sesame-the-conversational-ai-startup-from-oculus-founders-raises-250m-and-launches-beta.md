Sesame, a conversational AI startup and smart glasses maker, has raised a $250 million Series B round and is opening up its beta to a select group of testers, the company announced Tuesday. 
The startup, headed by former Oculus co-founder and CEO [Brendan Iribe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendaniribe/) and [Ankit Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankit-kumar-5a07479a/), former CTO of [AR startup Ubiquity6](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/discord-acquires-augmented-reality-startup-ubiquity6/), is working to create a personal AI agent that interacts with users using a natural-sounding human voice. The company plans to embed the personal AI agent into lightweight eyewear that is designed to be worn throughout the day and that users can interact with via voice.
The startup first [emerged from stealth](https://www.techmeme.com/250228/p25#a250228p25) in February, offering two demos of its technology — AI voices named “Maya” and “Miles.” The voices were soon accessed by more than a million people within the first few weeks, who generated more than 5 million minutes of conversation, according to a new [post](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-sesame-a-new-era-for-voice/) by Sesame investor Sequoia about its participation in the startup’s Series B.
“[T]he experience was unlike anything we’d used before. Sesame’s conversational layer felt different,” the post states. “It doesn’t just translate LLM output into audio — it generates speech directly, capturing the rhythm, emotion, and expressiveness of real dialogue.”
Early reviews of the tech demo seem to agree, as one report by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/621022/sesame-voice-assistant-ai-glasses-oculus-brendan-iribe) described Sesame as “genuinely fun” and “natural-sounding.”
Sesame says its upcoming glasses will offer “high-quality audio” and access to an AI companion that will “observe the world alongside you.”

Sequoia also noted the smartglasses Sesame is building will be fashion-forward, so they look like something you’d choose to wear even if they didn’t offer built-in AI technology. A timeframe for their availability is not yet being shared — as Sequoia noted, “hardware takes time.”
On that front, Sesame may have an advantage. Its founding team also includes Oculus co-founder [Nate Mitchell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natemitchell/) as its chief product officer, former Oculus COO and Fitbit exec [Hans Hartmann](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/oculus-snags-fitbit-exec-hans-hartmann-as-new-coo/) as COO, former Oculus engineer manager and Reality Labs engineering director [Ryan Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanhbrown/), and longtime Facebook and Meta exec [Angela Gayles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agayles/).
In addition to sharing the news of its Series B, Iribe [announced](https://x.com/brendaniribe/status/1980677775058162077) on X that Sesame is now opening an early beta of the Sesame iOS app. The app experience will allow testers to get hands-on with the AI technology being built, as the app will have the ability to “search, text and think,” he says.
Beta testers are asked to keep their testing experiences [confidential](https://www.sesame.com/beta-testing-agreement) for the time being, which includes not discussing features or results beyond the official beta test forums.
Investors in the Sesame Series B include Sequoia, Spark, and other undisclosed backers, [according](https://x.com/brendaniribe/status/1980682926275924331) to Iribe.
