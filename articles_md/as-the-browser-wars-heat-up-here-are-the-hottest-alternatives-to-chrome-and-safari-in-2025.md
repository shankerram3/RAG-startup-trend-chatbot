Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari currently dominate the web browser market, with Chrome holding a significant share due to the tech giant’s ongoing innovations, particularly in integrating generative AI into its search functionalities. 
However, users seeking alternatives will find a variety of browsers aiming to challenge these industry giants.
To help navigate the competitive landscape of the browser wars, we’ve compiled an overview of some of the top alternative browsers available today. This includes browsers leveraging AI, open source browsers that promote customization and privacy, and “mindful browsers” — a new term that refers to browsers designed to enhance user well-being.
## AI-powered browsers
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cmp_summarize_webpage.gif?w=680)**Image Credits:** Perplexity
### Perplexity’s Comet
Perplexity is the most recent startup in the space to [launch an AI-powered web browser](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/). Called [Comet](https://comet.perplexity.ai/?a=b), the company’s new product acts as a chatbot-based search engine, and can perform actions like summarizing emails, browsing web pages, and performing tasks such as sending calendar invites. It’s currently only available to users with Perplexity’s $200/month Max plan, but there’s also a waitlist where people can sign up.
### The Browser Company’s Dia
![Dia Hero](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dia-Hero-2-w_Write-Skill.jpeg?w=680)**Image Credits:** The Browser Company
The Browser Company, the startup behind the Arc browser, [recently introduced](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/) [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/), its AI-centric browser that looks similar to Google Chrome but with an AI chat tool. 
Currently available as an [invite-only beta](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/11/the-browser-company-launches-its-ai-first-browser-dia-in-beta/), Dia is designed to help users navigate the web more easily. It’s able to look at every website that a user has visited and every website they’re logged into, enabling it to help you find information and perform tasks. For instance, Dia can provide information about the page a user is currently browsing, answer questions about a product, and summarize uploaded files. 
To get early access to Dia, users have to be an Arc member. Non-members can join the waitlist. 
### Opera’s Neon
![Opera neon](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Opera-neon.png?w=680)**Image Credits:** Opera
Another [recent entry](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/28/operas-new-browser-can-code-websites-and-games-for-you/) into the AI agentic browser war is Opera’s [Neon](http://www.operaneon.com), which has contextual awareness and can do things like researching, shopping, and writing snippets of code. Notably, it can even perform tasks while the user is offline. 
Neon has yet to become available, but people can join the waitlist. It will be a subscription product; however, Opera hasn’t announced pricing yet. 
### OpenAI’s Atlas

OpenAI recently launched its AI-powered web browser, called [Atlas](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/openai-launches-an-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas/). The browser allows users to ask ChatGPT about search results and browse websites within the chatbot instead of being directed to outside links. There’s also an “agent mode” for users to ask ChatGPT to complete tasks on their behalf.
Atlas was first rumored to launch in [July](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/openai-is-reportedly-releasing-an-ai-browser-in-the-coming-weeks/); however, it only became available on macOS in October. It’s expected to arrive on Windows, iOS, and Android devices soon.
## Privacy-focused browsers
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bravebrowser.jpeg?w=680)**Image Credits:** Brave
### Brave
[Brave](https://brave.com) is among the more well-known [privacy-first browsers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/brave-launches-version-1-0-of-its-privacy-focused-browser/), popular for its built-in ad and tracker blocking capabilities. It also has a gamified approach to browsing, rewarding users with its own cryptocurrency called Basic Attention Token (BAT). When users choose to opt in to view ads, supporting their favorite websites, they get a share of the ad revenue. Additional features include a VPN service, [an AI assistant](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/03/brave-launching-ai-assistant-iphone-ipad-users/), and [a video calling feature](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/braves-non-tracking-browser-based-video-conferencing-tool-is-out-of-beta/). 
### DuckDuckGo
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Desktop-Home-1.jpg?w=680)**Image Credits:** DuckDuckGo
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) is another [browser](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/22/duckduckgos-windows-browser-is-now-available-in-open-beta/) that many people are probably already familiar with, thanks to its search engine by the same name. Launched in 2008, the company recently made significant investments in its browser to stay competitive by [introducing generative AI features](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/duckduckgo-leans-further-into-genai-as-its-ai-chat-interface-exits-beta/), such as a chatbot. It also [enhanced its scam blocker ](https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/19/duckduckgo-scam-blocker-detects-fake-stores-crypto-sites-virus-alerts-more/)to detect a wider range of scams, including fake cryptocurrency exchanges, scareware tactics, and fraudulent e-commerce websites. In addition to blocking scams, DuckDuckGo prevents trackers and ads, and it doesn’t track user data, resulting in fewer pop-ups for users.
### Ladybird
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ladybird-browser.jpeg?w=680)**Image Credits:** Ladybird
[Ladybird](https://ladybird.org), led by GitHub co-founder and former CEO Chris Wanstrath, has an ambitious mission compared to other rivals: It aims to build an entirely new open source browser from scratch. This means it will not rely on code from existing browsers, a feat that has rarely been accomplished. Most alternative web browsers depend on the Chromium open source project maintained by Google, which is the most widely used base for many browsers. 
Like other privacy-focused browsers, Ladybird will offer features to minimize data collection, such as a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. The browser has yet to be launched, with an alpha version scheduled for release in 2026 for early adopters, available on Linux and macOS.
### Vivaldi
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vivaldi.jpeg?w=680)**Image Credits:** Vivaldi
[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is a Chromium-based [browser](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/vivaldi-browser-gets-built-in-tracking-blocker-goes-ga-on-android/) created by one of the original developers of the Opera browser. Its biggest selling point is its customizable user interface, which allows users to change the appearance and enable or disable features. One unique feature is that the browser window changes color to match the website being viewed. Other key features include ad blocking, a password manager, no user data tracking, and productivity tools such as a calendar and notes.
## Niche browsers
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Opera-Air-Boosts.jpg?w=680)**Image Credits:** Opera
### Opera Air
Opera[ launched](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/opera-launches-a-mindfulness-browser-with-break-reminders-and-soundscapes/) the Air browser in February, becoming one of the first mindfulness-themed browsers in the space. While [Opera Air](https://www.opera.com/air?utm_source=opcom&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=opera-air-launch) functions like a typical web browser, it includes unique features designed to support mental well-being. These features consist of break reminders and breathing exercises. Another feature, called “Boosts,” provides a selection of binaural beats to either help improve focus or relaxation.
### SigmaOS
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SigmaOS.jpg?w=680)**Image Credits:** SigmaOS
[SigmaOS](https://sigmaos.com) is a Mac-only browser featuring a workspace-style interface that emphasizes productivity. It displays tabs vertically, allowing users to treat them like a to-do list that can be marked as complete or snoozed for later. Users can create workspaces — essentially groups of tabs — to better organize different activities, such as separating work from entertainment.
This Y Combinator-backed browser has [been around](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/sigmaos-raises-4-million-to-build-a-browser-for-productivity-nerds/) for a few years now and has most recently begun introducing more [AI features,](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/yc-backed-sigmaos-browser-turns-to-ai-powered-features-for-monetization/) including the ability to summarize various elements of a web page, such as ratings, reviews, and prices. It also has an [AI assistant](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/02/sigmaos-launches-a-contextual-ai-assistant-for-its-browser/) that can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content.
SigmaOS is free to use, but users who want more than three workspaces can subscribe to a plan for $8 per month, which provides unlimited workspaces.
### Zen Browser
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zenbrowser.jpeg?w=680)**Image Credits:** Zen Browser
[Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app) aims to create a “calmer internet” with its open source browser. Zen lets users organize tabs into Workspaces, and offers Split View to view two tabs side by side, among other productivity-focused features. Users can also enhance their browsing experience with community-made plug-ins and themes, such as a mod that makes the tab background transparent.
_This story has been updated after publication to include newly launched browsers._
