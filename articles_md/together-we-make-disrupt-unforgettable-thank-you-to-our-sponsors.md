[**TechCrunch Disrupt 2025**](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/) wouldn’t be what it is without the incredible companies that power the innovation behind the scenes. From headline partners to emerging collaborators, our sponsors help make Disrupt the ultimate destination for founders, investors, and visionaries shaping the future of tech. Their insights, technologies, and support bring each stage, session, and startup moment to life — turning bold ideas into real-world impact.
## Spotlight sessions you won’t want to miss
Our sponsors are shaping the future of industries — and you can [catch them live at Disrupt](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/agenda/):
### Tuesday October 28
#### AI Stage
##### AI Isn’t Failing. You’re Just Solving the Wrong Problems
2:35 p.m. – 2:55 p.m.  
Presented by **[SymphonyAI](http://www.symphonyai.com)**
The headlines say AI pilots are stalling, but global leaders are already scaling AI in production. From manufacturing to payments to retail, they’re proving success comes from focus: solving complex, domain-specific problems. This discussion goes beyond hype to reveal what breaks when AI meets business reality — and how enterprises are fixing it. Expect real-world insights on deployment barriers, the human impact of automation, and why deep expertise drives measurable results.
### **Wednesday October 29**
#### Builders Stage
##### Stablecoins, Startups, Salaries: The New Playbook for Global Hiring
10:40 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.  
Presented by: **[Pebl](https://hellopebl.com/)**
As startups scale globally, their biggest challenge isn’t finding talent — it’s paying them. Legacy payroll and banking systems can’t keep up with a distributed, digital-first workforce. Rising visa costs and shifting U.S. policies are accelerating the move to global hiring. Now fintech innovation is redefining payroll through digital wallets, stablecoins, and crypto rails, making payments faster, cheaper, and borderless. This session dives into why payroll is the next frontier of financial infrastructure, where compliance meets innovation and startups turn global teams into a competitive edge.
