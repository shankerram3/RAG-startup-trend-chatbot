## Sharing lessons on scaling blockchain and crypto adoption at Disrupt
Yakovenko will unpack Solana’s breakout year, the growing demand for scalable, low-cost blockchain infrastructure, and how the network is powering a new generation of decentralized apps. He’ll also share lessons from building through market cycles, what it takes to drive developer adoption at scale, and why he’s betting big on crypto’s mainstream future.
As one of the most technically respected voices in blockchain, Yakovenko brings more than a decade of engineering experience — from working at Qualcomm to founding one of the world’s fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems.
## Powering the future of finance and the rise of Solana
Anatoly Yakovenko is the CEO of [Solana Labs](https://www.solanalabs.com/) and co-founder of [Solana](https://solana.com/), an open, decentralized, high-performance blockchain powering next-gen finance and applications. Before founding Solana, he spent over a decade at Qualcomm as a systems engineer. He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign.
